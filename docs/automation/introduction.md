# Introduction 

Welcome to WebLOAD Professional, the premier performance, scalability, reliability testing solution for internet applications.  

WebLOAD is easy to use and delivers maximum testing performance and value. WebLOAD verifies the scalability and integrity of internet applications by generating a load composed of Virtual Clients that simulate real-world traffic. Probing Clients let you refine the testing process by acting as a single user that measures the performance of targeted activities, and provides individual performance statistics of the internet application under load. 

This section provides a brief introduction to WebLOAD technical support, including both documentation and online support. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: In previous WebLOAD versions, a WebLOAD script was called an "Agenda". From version 12.0, it is referred to simply as a script. Wherever "Agenda" is still displayed, we are referring to the WebLOAD script. 

WebLOAD Recorder was formerly referred to as WebLOAD IDE.
