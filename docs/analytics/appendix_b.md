# Appendix B: Understanding the Statistics

## Statistical Terms

The following table lists general terms used for the statistics. 



| **Term**                     | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Percentile                   | A **percentile** is the value of a variable below which  a certain percent of observations  fall. Thus the 30th percentile is the value (or score) below which 30 percent  of the observations may be found. |
| Average                      | The  **arithmetic mean**. For timers, average is the total amount of time  counted by the timer (not the elapsed time) divided by the Count (that is,  the total number of readings). For example, the average for Transaction Time  is the amount of time it took to complete all the successful transactions  divided by the number of successful transactions (the Count). |
| Standard  deviation (stddev) | The **standard  deviation** is a simple measure of the variability or dispersion of a data  set. A low standard deviation indicates that all of the data points are very  close to the same value (the mean). A high  standard  deviation indicates that the data is "spread out" over a large range of  values. |
