# Working with Portfolios

WebLOAD Analytics enables you to create a portfolio of templates that you can open in a single action. Use portfolios to group together commonly used templates to speed up your work.  

> **Note:** Generating, printing, and publishing individual charts within a portfolio or entire portfolios is identical to generating, printing, and publishing charts. For more information, see [*Generating Charts* ](generating_charts.md) 



## Creating a Portfolio

When you create a new portfolio, you assign the templates you wish to include by dragging them into your portfolio in the Templates Gallery tree. The assigned templates appear as links within the portfolio. 

> **Note:** If a template is deleted from the Templates Gallery and the portfolio links associated with it are not deleted, unresolved template links appear in the tree marked with a red x. When publishing the portfolio, templates with unresolved links are not published. 



**To create a portfolio:** 

1. In the Navigation area, click the **Gallery** tab. The Templates Gallery opens. 

1. In the Templates Gallery Right-click in the Templates Gallery and select **New Portfolio**.  

    The New Portfolio window opens. 

    ![new portfolio](../images/new_portfolio.png)

   

1. Enter a name for the portfolio and click **OK**. The new portfolio appears under the Portfolios folder in the Templates Gallery tree. 

1. In the Templates Galley, drag-and-drop the templates you want to include in your portfolio. 
    Your portfolio is created. 

   

> **Note:** To remove a template from your portfolio, select the template link from the  Templates Gallery tree and click ![delete icon](../images/delete_icon.png). Removing a template link from your portfolio does not delete it from the Templates Gallery. 



## Opening a Portfolio

**To open a portfolio:** 

1. In the Templates Gallery, open the Portfolios node. 
1. Double-click the portfolio you wish to open.  

     The charts created by the portfolio open in the Charts area. 

> **Note:** Any charts that were already open in the Charts area remain open. 

You can now generate, print, or publish a report based on the open charts. For more information, see
