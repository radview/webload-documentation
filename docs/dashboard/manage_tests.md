           The URL/API load test generates an increasing load over a set time frame until reaching a defined maximum load size. The maximum load size is then run for a set period after which the load is reduced back to the base load again over a time frame defined by the user. The load increments are calculated automatically by WebLOAD based on the parameters defined. 

           Thus, the load will start with 0 Virtual Users and  increase over the time frame defined in the **Ramp up time** field to reach the number of Virtual Users defined in the **Max Virtual Users** field. The test will then continue running with the maximum number of Virtual Clients for the period of time defined in the **Time to run Max Virtual Users** field, after which load will return to 0 Virtual Users value over the time frame set in the **Ramp down time** field. 

1. Select one of the following: 

     - **Create Test** – The test definitions are saved. 
    
     - **Create and Run Test** – The test definitions are  saved, and the test starts running immediately. 

     - **Run in Sandbox Mode** – The system saves all the test definitions,  but runs a limited test on the settings specified in the **Request Parameters** section while ignoring all the settings in the **Load Configuration**, **Load Generators**, and **Recurrence** sections. 

      This option is intended for SaaS users wishing to run a limited test prior to running the full test specified in the test definitions.  



## Creating a Script Load Test

Use this option to create a load test based on a WebLOAD script that was created in WebLOAD Recorder.

## Specifying Load Generators for a load test 

Load generators are machines that bombard tested site with transactions to test site scalability and integrity.  Both a [*URL/API Load Test* ](#creating-a-urlapi-load-test)and a[` `*Script Load Test* ](#creating-a-script-load-test)require you to specify the load generators that will participate in the test.  Note that the list of available load generators is defined by a Super Admin, as described in [*Adding Load Generators* ](./managing_load_generators.md#adding-load-generators)

**To specify the load generators participating in a load test:** 

1. Keep in mind that each Location in the list defines a group of one or more load generators having the same "Location" tag. For a detailed explanation, refer to [*Setting Load Generators’ Location Tag* ](./managing_load_generators.md#setting-load-generators-location-tag)

1. Select a group of load generators with an identical Location, by entering a non- zero percentage in the corresponding **%** column. The percentage specifies the relative weight of this group of load generators. 

    ![List of available load generators – as appearing in a load test page](../images/available_load_generators.png)


1. Make sure the sum of all the percentages is 100%. 

    ![specify load generators](../images/specify_load_generators.png)
