# Introduction

RadView’s WebLOAD Dashboard provides a single unified command and control interface for creating, executing, scheduling, and analyzing tests – all directly from your web browser, either on-premises or in the Cloud. 



Some of the tasks you can accomplish using WebLOAD Dashboard include: 

- Create and edit load tests – based on a WebLOAD script, a WebLOAD template, or using a single URL/API 
- Upload, add and manage tests, resources, and sessions 
- Execute and schedule test runs 
- Analyze results using ready-made and self-configured dashboards 
- Share tests and results with peers 
- Manage access permissions for users and groups  
- Download test results to your local machine for further analysis with WebLOAD Analytics 

Note: In previous WebLOAD versions, a WebLOAD script was called an "Agenda".
