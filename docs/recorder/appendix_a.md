## The WebLOAD Recorder General Toolbox

The following table describes the purpose of each of the WebLOAD Recorder General Toolbox items:

|**Script Item**|**Purpose**|
| :- | :- |
|Sleep|<p>Emulates the time it takes users to get from one page to the next</p><p>- includes download time and the time it takes to read the page.</p>|
|Message|Places an informational or error message in the script. This message will appear in the Log window when you play back the script. Message objects can also be used to print out the values of variables.|
|JavaScript Object|<p>Enables you to insert JavaScript code directly into the script. You can code directly in JavaScript.</p><p>To add a JavaScript Object to the script, drag the **JavaScript Object** icon into the Script Tree, and then open the object to insert JavaScript code.</p>|
|Comment|Places comments in your script. The comment will appear in the JavaScript View pane when viewing the entire script.|
|Try…Catch|Places Try and Catch statements in your script. You can use the Try...Catch statements for structured exception handling.|




### **Sleep**
Users vary their activity when accessing a Web application, sometimes pausing between transactions and occasionally only accessing the server intermittently. The time a user waits between performing consecutive actions is known as sleep time.

When you record a script, WebLOAD Recorder automatically records the actual sleep time and inserts sleep icons into the script. You can edit the recorded sleep times manually, add more sleep statements, and control how WebLOAD is influenced by the sleep timers in the script.

**To insert sleep timers:**

1. Drag the **Sleep ![](../images/appendix_a_010.png)** icon from the General toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location.

    The Sleep dialog box opens.

1. In the **Enter or select pause time** field, enter or select the duration of the sleep. The default value is 1000 milliseconds.

    The Sleep item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

### **Message**
While running a test session, WebLOAD Recorder and WebLOAD Recorder’s Log windows display information about session execution. You can include Message nodes in your script, defining points at which to send error and/or notification messages to the Log window.

**To insert a message:**

1. Drag the **Message ![](../images/appendix_a_012.png)** icon from the General toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location.

     The Message dialog box opens.

    ![Message Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_015.png)



1. Create a text message by typing the text you want to appear in the message into the input text box.
 
    > **Note:** When entering a string value to the message, the string must be enclosed in quotation marks; for example, "Sample Message".

1. To add a global variable to the message text, click the **globe** icon to the right of the input text box and select a global variable from the drop-down list.

1. Select a severity level for the message from the drop-down list. The following severity levels are available:

    - Information message (WLInfoMessage)
    - Minor error message (WLMinorError)
    - Error message (WLError)
    - Severe error message (WLSevereError)
    - Debug message (WLDebugMessage)

1. Click **OK**.

    The Message item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.




### JavaScriptObject
JavaScript Objects enable you to insert JavaScript code directly into the script, giving you access to advanced functionality not available through the WebLOAD Recorder graphic interface. For example, working with XML or COM, or retrieving data from a database, are all tasks that require some additional programming code.

**To insert a JavaScriptObject:**

1. Drag the **JavaScriptObject ![](../images/appendix_a_017.jpeg)** icon from the General toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location.

    The JavaScriptObject item appears in the Script Tree and the WebLOAD Recorder protocol block is added to the script.

1. Open the object in JavaScript Editing mode to insert JavaScript code, as described in [*Using the JavaScript Editor* ](./editing_scripts.md#using-the-javascript-editor).

### **Comment**
WebLOAD Recorder enables you to add comments to your script to describe an activity or provide information about a specific operation.

**To insert a comment:**

1. Drag the **Comment ![](../images/appendix_a_018.png)** icon from the General toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location.

    The Comment dialog box opens.

    ![Comment Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_019.png)

   

1. Enter the text you want to appear in the comment.

1. Click **OK**.




The Comment item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

### Try / Catch Statements
You can use the Try…Catch statements for structured exception handling. This enables you to execute a particular block of statements if a specified exception occurs while your code is running.

**To insert a Try...Catch statement:**

1. Drag the **Try ![](../images/appendix_a_021.png)** icon from the General toolbox into the Script Tree directly before the first action you want to include in the Try...Catch block.
1. Drag the **Catch ![](../images/appendix_a_022.png)** icon from the General toolbox into the Script Tree directly after the last action you want to include in the Try...Catch block.
    
    The Try and Catch items appear in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.



## The WebLOAD Recorder Load Toolbox

The following table describes the purpose of each of the WebLOAD Recorder Load Toolbox items:

*Table: Load Toolbox Items*

|**Script Item**|**Purpose**|
| :- | :- |
|<p>Begin Transactions</p><p>End Transactions</p>|Adds named transactions to the script to measure the performance of logical actions in your script, such as a Login process. By inserting named transactions into your script, you can take a series of simple actions, define them as a single transaction, and set success or failure criteria for the complete transaction.|
|<p>Set Timer</p><p></p><p>Send Time</p>|Timers let you time any operation or group of operations in a script and send the time statistics to the WebLOAD Console.|
|SynchronizationPo int|Create peak server loads that stress your system to the limit by deliberately forcing multiple Virtual Clients to perform key tasks and execute a given command at precisely the same moment in real time.|
|SendMeasurement|Create a new measurement name and assign a value to the measurement available in WebLOAD reports.|
|URL Screening|Specify the URLs the WebLOAD engine should ignore (not fetch).|
|ValueExtraction|Extract a value from a string using a prefix and suffix.|
|DefineConcurrent|Define a starting point after which the WebLOAD engine collects all Post and Get HTTP requests, but does not execute them, until an Execute Concurrent function is run.|
|ExecuteConcurrent|Defines a starting point after which the WebLOAD engine stops collecting and begins executing all the Post and Get HTTP requests that were defined since the last Define Concurrent function, concurrently (using multithreading).|



### **Begin and End Transaction**
In addition to the automatic transactions provided by WebLOAD, you can use the WebLOAD Recorder GUI to easily add named transactions to the script to measure the performance of logical actions in your script, such as a Login process. By inserting named transactions into your script, you can take a series of simple actions, define them as a transaction, and set success or failure criteria for the transaction. Each transaction can be a simple action, such as a query, or a complex action that may include several steps.

To measure transactions, you must mark the beginning and end of the transaction in your script. During runtime, WebLOAD measures the time it takes to complete the transaction and reports the results in the WebLOAD Integrated reports, Statistics reports, and Data Drilling report.

> **Note:** You can add an unlimited number of transactions into your script, each with a different name.

**To mark the beginning of a transaction:**

1. Drag the **Begin Transaction ![](../images/appendix_a_023.png)** icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree, directly above the first action you want to include in the transaction.

    The Begin Transaction dialog box opens.

    ![Begin Transaction Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_024.png)

1. Enter a logical name for the transaction; for example, Login.

1. Click **OK**.

    The Begin Transaction item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

   

**To mark the end of a transaction:**

1. Drag the **End Transaction ![](../images/appendix_a_025.png)** icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree, directly after the last action you want included in the script.
 
    The End Transaction dialog box opens.

    ![End Transaction Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_026.png)

1. Select the transaction to end from the Select Opened Transaction drop-down list.

1. Select a return value for the transaction from Select Return Value drop-down list.

    You can select from the return values provided, or select Custom Function to create your own verification function to call when the transaction is complete.

    For information on creating custom functions, see the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*.

1. To set WebLOAD to save the results of all transaction instances, successes and failures, for later analysis with Data Drilling, select **true** in the Save transaction information for Data Drilling field. Select **false** (default) to save only results of failed transaction instances that triggered some sort of error flag.

1. Optionally, enter a text string to specify a possible reason for a transaction failure within your transaction verification function in the Failure Reason field. This reason will also appear in the Statistics Report.

1. Click **OK**.

    The End Transaction item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

### Set and Send Timer
Timers let you time any operation or group of operations in a script and send the time statistics to the WebLOAD Console. For example, you can add a timer to measure the amount of time needed to complete a series of user activities on a single Web page.

You can add timers to a script directly through the WebLOAD Recorder.

> **Note:** When you set a timer, it is automatically zeroed.

**To mark the beginning of a timer:**

1. Drag the **Set Timer ![](../images/appendix_a_028.png)** icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree directly before the first action you want to include in the timed task.

    The Set Timer dialog box opens.

    ![Set Timer Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_029.png)


1. Type a name for the timer in the Enter a timer name field.

1. Click **OK**.

    The Set Timer item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

   

**To mark the end of the timer:**

1. Drag the **Send Time**r ![](../images/appendix_a_030.png) icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree directly after the last action you want included in the timed task.

    The Send Timer dialog box opens.

    ![](../images/appendix_a_031.png)

    *Figure: Send Timer Dialog Box*

1. From the Select Timer drop-down list, to select the timer to end.
1. Click **OK**.
    The Send Timer item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

### Synchronization Point
During a test session, WebLOAD simulates the random nature of the real world, where even with hundreds or thousands of Web site hits, users do not all necessarily execute the same commands at precisely the same instant. However, for testing purposes, you may wish to create peak server loads that stress your system to the limit by deliberately forcing multiple Virtual Clients to perform key tasks and execute a given command at precisely the same moment in real time.

WebLOAD provides Synchronization Points to coordinate the actions of multiple Virtual Clients. A Synchronization Point is a meeting place where Virtual Clients wait before continuing with a script. When one Virtual Client arrives at a Synchronization Point, WebLOAD holds the Client at that point until all the other Virtual Clients arrive. When all the Virtual Clients have arrived, they are all released at once to perform the next action in the script simultaneously.

For example, suppose that you want to simulate 500 users, all trying to access a form on the same Web page simultaneously. To maximize the impact of this test situation, all 500 Virtual Clients must access the form at exactly the same time. Add a Synchronization Point before the form entry node to ensure that all the Virtual Clients log in simultaneously.

WebLOAD Recorder enables you to define the meeting place where all Virtual Clients wait. You can also optionally set the timeout value, the number of milliseconds that WebLOAD will wait for all of the Virtual Clients to arrive at the Synchronization Point. The timeout is a safety mechanism that prevents an infinite wait if any of the Virtual Clients does not arrive at the Synchronization Point for any reason. Once the timeout period expires, WebLOAD releases the rest of the Virtual Clients. Setting a timeout

value is important to ensure that the test session will not ‘hang’ indefinitely in case of error.

**To insert a Synchronization Point:**

1. Drag the **Synchronization Point ![](../images/appendix_a_032.png)** icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree directly before the action you want all Virtual Clients to perform simultaneously. The Synchronization Point dialog box opens.

    ![Synchronization Point Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_033.png)

1. In the Timeout Value field, enter or select a timeout value for the Synchronization Point. The default value is 1000 milliseconds.

    The Synchronization Point item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

During a test session, the SynchronizationPoint() function returns a value to WebLOAD. This value indicates whether the function was successful or not. All failures are logged and displayed in the WebLOAD and Console Log windows, similar to any other WebLOAD test failure.

Synchronization Point function calls may return one of the following return values:

- WLSuccess—synchronization succeeded. All Virtual Clients arrived at the Synchronization Point and were released together.
- WLLoadChanged—synchronization failed. A change in the load size was detected while Virtual Clients were being held at the Synchronization Point. All Virtual clients were released.
- WLTimeout—synchronization failed. The timeout expired before all Virtual Clients arrived at the Synchronization Point. All Virtual Clients were released.
- WLError—synchronization failed. Invalid timeout value. All Virtual Clients were released.

For a complete explanation and example of the SynchronizationPoint function syntax, see WebLOAD Actions, Objects, and Functions*,* in the *WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide*.



### Send Measurement
WebLOAD Recorder enables you to insert Send Measurement actions into your script to create a new measurement name and assign a value to the measurement. During runtime the measurement is displayed in the WebLOAD statistics report.

**To create and set the value for a measurement:**

1. Drag the **Send Measurement ![](../images/appendix_a_034.png)** icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location.

    The Send Measurement dialog box opens.

    ![Send Measurement Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_035.png)
 

1. Type or select a name for the measurement in the Select measurement name field.

1. Type or select a value for the measurement in the Set measurement value field.

1. Click **OK**.

    The Send Measurement item appears in the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

### URL Screening
WebLOAD Recorder enables you to add URL screening to a script to define the URLs that the WebLOAD protocol engine should ignore during runtime. The ability to ignore links on the page being tested is a useful feature. For example, many Web sites include links to external sites. If these sites are not relevant to the testing requirements, they should be ignored. Other links may be to advertisement sites that charge a fee every time the link is accessed. Hitting these links during a typical load test that may run hundreds or thousands of iterations would be a tremendous waste, so these links should also be ignored.

**To add URL screening to a script:**

1. Drag the **URL Screening ![](../images/appendix_a_036.png)** icon, from the Load toolbox, into the Script Tree at the desired location. 

    The URL Screening Building Block parameters dialog box opens.

    ![URL Screening Building Block Parameters Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_037.png)

   

1. Enter the URLs to ignore, separated by commas, in the Value field.

1. Click **OK**.

    The URL Screening Building Block is added to the Script Tree. The JavaScript code, including the InitAgenda() function, is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

> **Note:** Fields that were not assigned a value in the dialog box are left as empty fields in the script code.

### Value Extraction
WebLOAD Recorder enables you to add value extraction to a script to define the parameters for the extractValue JavaScript function.

**To add value extraction to a script:**

1. Drag the **Value Extraction ![](../images/appendix_a_038.png)** icon, from the Load toolbox, into the Script Tree at the desired location. 

    The Value Extraction Building Block parameters dialog box opens.

    ![Value Extraction Building Block Parameters Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_039.png)

1. In the Prefix field, enter a prefix.

1. In the Suffix field, enter a suffix.

1. In the Str field, enter the string that will be searched.

1. In the retVarName, enter the variable name that will be generated to the script.

1. Click **OK**.

    The Value Extraction Building Block is added to the Script Tree. The JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

> **Note:** Fields that were not assigned a value in the dialog box are left as empty fields in the script code.

### **Define Concurrent**
WebLOAD Recorder enables you to collect Post and Get HTTP requests and simultaneously execute them by two or more threads, as defined in the MultiThread Virtual Clients number. This is configured in the Browser Parameters tab in WebLOAD Console’s Script Options dialog box.

> **Note:** WebLOAD Recorder does not perform the Post and Get HTTP requests concurrently.

To simultaneously execute Post and Get HTTP requests, you must define where in the script to begin collecting the requests and where to stop collecting and begin executing them. The HTTP requests are collected until the engine encounters an Execute Concurrent function in the script. For more information about the Execute Concurrent Building Block, see [*Execute Concurrent* ](#execute-concurrent).

These Post and Get HTTP requests are saved in a file which you can access at any time. For more information, refer to the *WebLOAD JavaScript Reference*.

**To start collecting HTTP requests in a script:**

- Drag the **Define Concurrent** ![](../images/appendix_a_040.png) icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location.

  The Define Concurrent Building Block is added to the Script Tree. The JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

### **Execute Concurrent**
WebLOAD Recorder enables you to simultaneously execute all the Post and Get HTTP requests that were defined since the last Define Concurrent function by two or more threads, as defined in the MultiThread Virtual Clients number. This is configured in the Browser Parameters tab in WebLOAD Console’s Script Options dialog box.

> **Note:** This function can only be inserted in your script *after* a Define Concurrent function. For more information about the Define Concurrent function, see [*Define Concurrent* ](#define-concurrent).



When the engine encounters the Execute Concurrent function, it stops collecting the HTTP requests in the script and starts their execution.

**To start concurrently executing HTTP requests in a script:**

- Drag the **Execute Concurrent** ![](../images/appendix_a_041.png) icon from the Load toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location.

The Execute Concurrent Building Block is added to the Script Tree. The JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

## The WebLOAD Recorder Internet Protocols Toolbox

Use the WebLOAD Recorder Internet Protocols Building Blocks to simply and easily add Internet Protocols functionality to your test session script without having to write numerous lines of code.

**To add Internet Protocols Building Blocks to a test script directly through the WebLOAD Recorder GUI:**

- Drag the selected Internet Protocols icon from the Internet Protocols toolbox and drop it into the Script Tree at the appropriate point.

  WebLOAD Recorder automatically adds the appropriate JavaScript code to your test session script.

WebLOAD Recorder provides full support for secure sites that utilize the SSL security protocol. The same FTP, POP, and SMTP functionality that is available for standard- security sites is also provided for sites that utilize the SSL security protocol. WebLOAD Recorder SSL protocol support is virtually transparent for the web site tester. Simply choose the appropriate Building Block, such as FTP-Connect, for example. Activate the SSL Protocol feature by setting the Boolean SSLFlag property to true. Complete the rest of the Building Block properties as described for standard Building Block use.

> **Note:** The Internet Protocols Building Blocks displayed in the Internet Protocols toolbox correspond to only a small part of the WebLOAD Recorder Internet Protocols function set. These Building Blocks are provided for the most commonly used Internet Protocols activities. For a description of the complete set of Internet Protocols functions supported by WebLOAD Recorder, see the *WebLOAD Internet Protocols Reference* in the *WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide*.


Each Internet Protocols icon opens a different dialog box. Enter the required values in the Value field. Explanations are provided at the bottom of the dialog box for each parameter as it is selected in the dialog box.

> **Note:** Values that must be enclosed within quotation marks are indicated in the Value column by sets of quotation marks. Type the field value within the quotation marks that automatically appear in the input-text box that pops-up when the value field is selected. Fields that were not assigned a value in the dialog box are left as empty fields in the script code.

Once you have finished defining the new Internet Protocols activity, the new action is reflected in the Script Tree. An Internet Protocols icon is added to the Script Tree for each Internet Protocols activity defined. WebLOAD Recorder automatically adds the corresponding JavaScript code to your test session script.

To see the complete sequence of JavaScript code for all the Internet Protocols Building Blocks that have been added to the Script Tree, click the Agenda root node in the Script Tree.

> **Note:** The JavaScript code for each of the Internet Protocols Building Blocks can be found in the Internet Protocols library files, part of the Include directory under the WebLOAD installation directory. Each protocol has its own library file. For example, the SMTP functions refer to the wlSMTP.js file.
>

### FTP
Dragging an FTP icon into your Script Tree opens an FTP Building Block parameters dialog box.

#### FTPS

The FTP building block can be used to access FTPS servers. FTPS - 'FTP over SSL', not to be confued with [SFTP](#sftp) - 'SSH FTP'. To use FTPS, use the FTP building block and specify Secure FTP 'Yes' in the connection setttings.

FTP toolbox items include:

- **FTP-Connect**: Open an FTP connection.
- **FTP-Upload**: Designate a file to be uploaded to a remote host.
- **FTP-Download**: Designate a file to be downloaded from a remote host.
- **FTP-Disconnect**: Disconnect from a remote host.

#### FTP-Connect

Use the FTP-Connect Building Block to open an FTP connection.

**To enter a value:**

    For example, in the preceding figure, the comment area explains that the UserName field is used to define the user ID to be used when logging in to the specified FTP host. WebLOAD Recorder automatically sends the user-specified name and password to the FTP host when connecting.

1. Enter the appropriate field value into the Value column next to the field name, as described the [Table](#ftp_connect).

1. Click **OK**.

    The FTP-Connect Building Block is added to the Script Tree. The JavaScript code, including the InitAgenda()and InitClient() functions, is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

    In the script, the InitAgenda()function notes that the connection will be utilizing SSL security, and therefore includes the WebLOAD Recorder FTP/SSL library file. The InitClient() function includes a command to define a separate FTP/SSL object for each client. Within the main body of the script, an FTP connection is opened using the connection name, user name, and password specified by the user.


<a name = "ftp_connect"></a>
The fields in the FTP-Connect Building Block parameters dialog box are described in the following table:

|**Field Name**|**Description**|

1. Click the name of an input field in the left-hand column to see an explanation of that field in the comment area at the bottom of the dialog box.

    For example, in the preceding figure, the comment area explains that the Uploaded File field is used to define the name and location for the file to be saved on the specified FTP host.

1. Enter the appropriate field value into the Value column next to the field name, as described the [Table](#ftp_upload). 

    > **Note:** If the script will be running for multiple clients or over multiple rounds, use global variables to specify a unique file name for each client and/or round, to avoid file access conflicts and to make it easier to work with and analyze the files after the test is completed. For example:
    >
    > `"k:\Ftp\files\inputFiles\text\_upload\_"+ ThreadNum + RoundNum + ".txt"`
 
1. Click **OK**.

   The FTP-Upload **B**uilding Block is added to the Script Tree and the JavaScript code is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

   > **Note:** The WebLOAD Recorder global variables ThreadNum and RoundNum are used to differentiate between the files uploaded by different clients during different test iterations.


<a name ="ftp_upload"></a>

The fields in the FTP-Upload Building Block parameters dialog box are described in the following table:

|**Field Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |

## The WebLOAD Recorder Database Toolbox

The WebLOAD Recorder Database Toolbox includes a complete set of database Building Blocks. Use the WebLOAD Recorder database Building Blocks to simply and easily add database activities to your test session script.

**To add database Building Blocks to a test script directly through WebLOAD Recorder:**

- Drag the selected database Building Block from the Database toolbox and drop it into the Script Tree at the appropriate point.

The following are the database Building Blocks available in WebLOAD Recorder:

![](../images/appendix_a_121.png)


Each database Building Block opens a different dialog box. Enter the required values in the Value field. Explanations are provided at the bottom of the dialog box for each parameter as it is selected in the dialog box.



> **Note:** The values that appear in the Wizard’s Value area are the default values for each field. In most cases, the default value for string variables is an empty string, indicated in the Value area by a set of empty quotation marks. If you are entering your own value for a string field, the new string must also be enclosed within quotation marks. Fields that were not assigned a value in the dialog box are left as empty fields in the script code.

Once you have finished defining the new database Building Block, the new activity is reflected in the Script Tree. A database Building Block is added to the Script Tree for each database Building Block defined. WebLOAD Recorder automatically adds the corresponding JavaScript code to your test session script.

To see the complete sequence of JavaScript code for all the Database Building Blocks that have been added to the Script Tree, click the Agenda root node in the Script Tree and select the JavaScript View tab.

> **Notes:** The JavaScript code for each of the Database Building Blocks can be found in the DBBuildingBlocks.js library file, which is part of the Include directory under the WebLOAD installation directory. The JavaScript code that implements these Database Building Blocks is automatically inserted to the appropriate locations within the script. Code lines may be added to the initialization phase (within the InitAgenda() function), in the main body of the script, or to the termination phase (within the TerminateAgenda() function).

The JavaScript code for that object can be edited, as described in [*Using the JavaScript Editor* ](./editing_scripts.md#using-the-javascript-editor)*.

The field descriptions in this section assume a basic familiarity with database terminology. To take full advantage of the Database Building Blocks, testers must understand how to work with ADO objects and have a basic knowledge of SQL command syntax. WebLOAD Recorder automatically inserts into the test session script the appropriate JavaScript code to implement the database commands that the tester specifies. However, it is the tester’s responsibility to specify valid database commands.

### Oracle DB GetLine
When running large load tests, the user input is usually read automatically from an input file. To read many rows of input data from a simple text file, WebLOAD uses the Oracle GetLine() I/O command. To read large amounts of input data from an Oracle database, WebLOAD uses the equivalent Oracle DBGetLine database Building Block.

The Oracle DB GetLine Building Block reads complete records, one by one, from a specified database table. The database table is exported into a temporary file, from which the records are read, one record per line.

> **Note:** To use the Oracle DB GetLine Building Block you must first install the Oracle Client. The Oracle Client must be installed on the same machine as the WebLOAD Recorder.

**To enter a value:**

1. Drag the **Oracle DB GetLine** icon from the Database toolbox into the Script Tree at the desired location.

    The Oracle DB GetLine Building Block parameters dialog box opens.

## The WebLOAD Recorder Verifications Toolbox

The following table describes the purpose of each of the WebLOAD Recorder Verifications Toolbox items:

|**Script Item**|**Purpose**|
| :- | :- |
|WS-Single|Verifies the value of the first element returned by the query to the Web service (WS).|
|WS-Multiple|Verifies the value of every element returned by the query to the Web service (WS).|
|Flex:Verify-Ext|Verifies data in the AMF data response.|
|Flex:Extract-Ext|Extracts data from AMF data response|



**To add Verifications Building Blocks to a test script directly through the WebLOAD Recorder:**

- Drag the selected verification Building Block from the Verifications toolbox and drop it into the Script Tree immediately after the node that represents the response you wish to verify.

Each Verifications Building Block opens a different dialog box. Enter the required values in the Value fields. Explanations are provided at the bottom of the dialog box for each parameter as it is selected in the dialog box.



> **Note:** The values that appear in the dialog box Value area are the default values for each field. In most cases, the default value for string variables is an empty string, indicated in the Value area by a set of empty quotation marks. If you are entering your own value for a string field, the new string must also be enclosed within quotation marks. Fields that were not assigned a value in the dialog box are left as empty fields in the script code.

A Verifications node is added to the Script Tree for each Verifications Building Block defined. WebLOAD Recorder automatically adds the corresponding JavaScript code to your test session script.

### WS-Single
The WS-Single Building Block enables you to automatically generate a verification function of the value of the first element in a Web service’s response, in your script. During playback, the results of the verification process (failure or success) are displayed in the Log View window.

If the verification succeeds, a Debug message is written to the Log View (with the element name and actual value) and the function returns WLSuccess. If the verification fails, a Warning message is displayed and the function returns WLMinorError.

**To insert a WS-Single Building Block:**

1. Drag the **WS-Single** icon from the Verifications toolbox into the Script Tree immediately after the node that represents the response you wish to verify.

    The WS-Single Node Building Block parameters dialog box opens.

    ![WS-Single Node Building Block Parameters Dialog Box](../images/appendix_a_143.png)

   

1. Edit the dialog box fields according to the following table.

   

    | **Field Name** | **Description**                                      |
    | :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
    | XML Node Path  | The XPath query string of the object to be verified. |
    | XML Node Value | The desired response of the verification.            |
    | Return Value   | The return value in case of failure.                 |

   
1. Click **OK**.

    The WS-Single node is added to the Script Tree. The JavaScript code, including the InitAgenda()function, is added to the script. To see the new JavaScript code, view the script in JavaScript Editing mode.

    For example:

```javascript
function InitAgenda()
{
//Start generation for Building Block WS - Single Node

IncludeFile("wlXmlVerification.js", WLExecuteScript); wlGlobals.SaveSource = true;
xmlDom	= InitXML();

//End generation for Building Block WS - Single Node
}

/***** WLIDE - WS - Single Node - ID:2 *****/

VerifyXMLNode(document.wlSource, "//Result", "2")

// END WLIDE
```



> **Note:** After the verification function is created in the script, you can duplicate it several times within the script to verify different response values.




### WS-Multiple
The WS-Multiple Building Block enables you to automatically generate a verification function of the values of every element in a Web service’s response, in your script.

During playback, the result of the verification process (failure or success) is displayed in the Log View window.

If the verification succeeds, a Debug message is written to the Log View (with the element name and actual value) and the function returns WLSuccess. If the verification fails, a Warning message is displayed and the function returns WLMinorError.

**To insert a WS-Multiple Building Block:**

1. Drag the **WS-Multiple** icon from the Verifications toolbox into the Script Tree immediately after the node that represents the response you wish to verify.

    The WS-Multiple Nodes Building Block parameters dialog box opens.

## The JMS Toolbox

The following table describes the purpose of each of the WebLOAD Recorder JMS Toolbox items:

|**Script Item**|**Purpose**|
| :- | :- |
|JMS-Connect-JNDI|Connect to a JMS queue, and create consumer and producer objects using JNDI.|
|JMS-Connect- HornetQ|Connect to a JMS queue, and create consumer and producer objects using HornetQ implementation.|
|JMS--Send|Send a JMS message using a previously created producer.|
|JMS-Receive|Receive a JMS message from a previously created consumer.|

**To use JMS in WebLOAD:**

1. Create JMS consumer and producer objects, either through JNDI or using the HornetQ implementation.
1. Use send and/or receive to put or get messages from a queue.

    > **Note:** The implementation relies on the WebLOAD Java connection, which enables making changes to the generated code easily. Refer to the "Working with Java" section of the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide* for more details.



### **JMS-Connect-JNDI**
The JMS-Connect-JNDI Building Block creates a JMS connection using JNDI. More specifically, the following objects are used:

- InitialContext – JNDI context
- JMS Connection Factory – looked up using JNDI
- JMS Destination (Queue) – looked up using JNDI
- JMS Session – using the JMS Connection
- JMS Producer and Consumer – using the session and destination

The objects are created in InitClient to be used once per virtual client. If required, some or all of the code can be moved to the script body to repeat the action each round.

The code can be adjusted as needed, for example by adding properties to the lookup:

```
env = new Packages.java.util.Properties(); env.put("INITIAL\_CONTEXT\_FACTORY", "my.factory");

env.put("PROVIDER\_URL", ["http://10.0.1.11");](http://10.0.1.11/)

jndiContext = new Packages.javax.naming.InitialContext(env);
```



**To insert a JMS-Connect-JNDI Building Block:**

1. Drag the **JMS-Connect-JNDI** icon from the JMS toolbox into the Script Tree. The JMS-Connect-JNDI Building Block parameters dialog box opens.

//Start generation for Building Block JMS-Connect-JNDI IncludeFile("wljms.js",WLExecuteScript);

//End generation for Building Block JMS-Connect-JNDI

}

function InitClient()

{

//Start generation for Building Block JMS-Connect-JNDI

jndiContext = new Packages.javax.naming.InitialContext();

connectionFactory = jndiContext.lookup("/myConFact");

dest = jndiContext.lookup("/myQueue");

connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();

session = connection.createSession(false, Packages.javax.jms.Session.AUTO\_ACKNOWLEDGE);

producer = session.createProducer(dest); consumer = session.createConsumer(dest); connection.start();

//End generation for Building Block JMS-Connect-JNDI

}

/***** WLIDE - JMS-Connect-JNDI - ID:2 *****/

//JMS 'producer' and 'consumer' objects created at InitClient()

// END WLIDE

function TerminateClient()

{

//Start generation for Building Block JMS-Connect-JNDI connection.close();

//End generation for Building Block JMS-Connect-JNDI

}
```



### JMS-Connect-HornetQ
The JMS-Connect-HornetQ Building Block creates a JMS connection using the HornetQ native implementation.

More specifically, the HornetQJMSClient class is used to create the connection factory and queue, as follows:

- Create JMS Connection Factory using HornetQJMSClient

- Create JMS Queue using HornetQJMSClient
- Create standard JMS objects – consumer, producer, session using the created objects

The objects are created in InitClient to be used once per virtual client. If required, some or all of the code can be moved to the script body to repeat the action each round.

> **Note:** HornetQ supports different ways of creating the connection. The code can be adjusted to support methods other that the method described here..

**To insert a JMS-Connect-HornetQ Building Block:**

1. Drag the **JMS-Connect-HornetQ** icon from the JMS toolbox into the Script Tree. The JMS-Connect- HornetQ Building Block parameters dialog box opens.
