# Configuring the WebLOAD Recorder Options

You can set the following WebLOAD Recorder configuration options:

- **Default Project Options** – Settings for WebLOAD Recorder that will be in effect for each script you create. These options are for the playback.
- **Current Project Options** – Settings that will override the Default Project Options settings.
- **Recording and Script Generation Options** – Settings that define the behavior of WebLOAD Recorder during the recording and script generation of a Web session.
- **Settings** – Settings for WebLOAD Recorder.
- **Customize** – Settings for the toolbar.
- **Parameterization Manager** – Settings for replacing a recorded static value in a script with a random value from a pool of values, or with a whole set of values from a file.


## Configuring the Default and Current Project Options

The Project Options are settings for WebLOAD Recorder that will be in effect for each script you create.

- **Default Project Options** are settings that will be in effect for each script you create. Each script created or edited in WebLOAD Recorder is automatically assigned these defaults. You can modify these settings to your specifications.
-**Current Project Options** are settings that will override the Default Project Options settings and affect only the currently open script. You can modify these settings to your specifications.

> ##### **Notes:**
> The Current Project Options dialog boxes are the same as the Default Project Options dialog boxes *except* for the title.
>
> You must be in Edit mode to modify the options.

The following table describes the fields and buttons in the Browser Parameters tab.

|**Field**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|*Browser Type*|The browser type and user-agent setting specify the type of browser the Virtual Clients should emulate. By default, all Virtual Clients use the WebLOAD Recorder default browser agent.|
|**Select the browser**|You can set WebLOAD Recorder to emulate any of the standard browsers.|
|**Select the user-agent**|You can specify any specific application by supplying a custom user-agent that is included in all HTTP headers.|
|*Cache*|The types of cache to simulate.|
|**DNS Cache**|<p>Caches the IP addresses received from the domain name server, reducing the domain name resolution time.</p><p>Disable DNS caching if you want to include the time for domain name resolution in the WebLOAD performance statistics.</p>|
|**SSL Cache**|<p>Caches the SSL decoding keys received from an SSL server, so that WebLOAD Recorder only receives the key on the first SSL connection in each round. In subsequent connections, WebLOAD Recorder retrieves the key from cache. Enabling SSL Cache also reduces transmission time during SSL communication.</p><p>Disable SSL caching if you want to measure the transmission time of the decoding key in the WebLOAD performance statistics for each SSL connection.</p>|
|*Redirection*||
|**Enable redirection**|Enables the redirection.|
|**Redirection limit**|Sets the redirection limit.|
|*Persistent Connection*||
|**Persistent connection (keep-alive)**|When enabled, WebLOAD Recorder keeps an HTTP connection alive between successive accesses in the same round of the main script. Keeping a connection alive saves time between accesses. WebLOAD attempts to keep the connection alive unless you switch to a different server. However, some HTTP servers may refuse to keep a connection alive. You should not keep a connection alive if establishing the connection is part of the performance test.|
|*HTTP properties*||
|**Gzip support**|<p>Sets the wlGlobals.AcceptEncodingGzip flag.</p><p>When this flag is set, WebLOAD Recorder behaves as follows:</p><p>1. For each request, sends the header "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate". This informs the server that the client can accept zipped content.</p><p>2. `	`When this header is turned on, the server MAY send a response with the header "content-encoding: gzip" or "content-encoding: deflate". If either of these headers is sent, it means that the response is zipped/deflated and WebLOAD Recorder will unzip/inflate the content.</p><p></p><p>**Note:** Most servers will work correctly even if the client does not send the "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" header.</p><p>Therefore, unless needed, it is recommended not to set the wlGlobals.AcceptEncodingGzip flag because it is performance heavy. However, some servers will fail if it is not sent. Microsoft Internet Explorer/Mozilla sends it by default.</p><p></p><p>You can manually code the script to send the "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" header even if the wlGlobals.AcceptEncodingGzip flag is not set. In this case, if the server returns zipped content, WebLOAD Recorder will not unzip it.</p>|
|*Character Encoding*||
|**Select the character encoding value**|Contains the value corresponding to the character set being used. The default value is Default (0), the regional settings of the computer.|
|**Enforce character encoding**|Indicates whether the parser should use the character set it parses in the HTML pages or override it using the value specified in the Select Character Encoding drop-down list. The default value is false (use the encoding from the HTML pages).|



##### Editing Browser Version Definitions

The available browser version list is appropriate for the browser type you select. You can add to the browser version list.

> **Note:** If you are working in the Current Project options dialog box, adding a browser version to the list only affects the current session. When you restart the application, the original browser version list is used. If you are working in the Default Project options dialog box, the updated browser version list is saved for future sessions as well.

**To add a browser version:**

1. Click the browse button in the **Browser Type** area on the Browser Parameters tab. The User Agent dialog box opens.

    ![User Agent Dialog Box](../images/user_agent_dia.png)

1. Manually edit the version definition.

1. Click **OK**.



### Setting the HTTP Parameters
The HTTP Parameters option enables you to define HTTP client behavior on the HTTP protocol level.

**To set the HTTP Parameters options:**

1. Click **Default/Current Project Options** in the **Tools** tab of the ribbon. The Default/Current Project Options dialog box opens.

1. Select the **HTTP Parameters** tab. The HTTP Parameters tab appears at the front of the dialog box. 

    ![HTTP Parameters Dialog Box](../images/http_para.png)

   

1. Set the HTTP version by clicking **HTTP version 1.0** or **HTTP version 1.1**.

1. Select one or more **HTTP properties** checkboxes.

1. Click **OK**.



The following table describes the fields and buttons in the HTTP Parameters dialog box.

|**Field**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|*HTTP version*|The appropriate HTTP protocol version (for example "HTTP/1.1").|
|**HTTP version 1.0**|Sets the HTTP protocol version to 1.0.|
|**HTTP version 1.1**|Sets the HTTP protocol version to 1.1.|
|*HTTP properties*||
|**Multi IP support**|<p>Sets the wlGlobals.MultiIPSupport flag to indicate that the HTTP protocol version supports more than one IP address.</p><p>If this option is selected, WebLOAD takes all IP addresses defined on the Load Generator machine. However, you can exclude specific IP addresses by modifying the WebLOAD.ini configuration file.</p><p>To exclude certain IP addresses, open the WebLOAD.ini file in</p><p>`<RadView directory>`\bin and locate the following line:</p><p>EXCLUDED\_IPS=" "</p><p>Enter the IP addresses you wish to exclude. If you enter multiple addresses, use a pipe delimiter between addresses as in the following example:</p><p>EXCLUDED\_IPS="127.0.0.1|
|**Encode form data**|<p>Sets the wlGlobals.EncodeFormdata flag.</p><p>In general, when an HTTP client (Microsoft Internet Explorer/Firefox or WebLOAD Recorder) sends a post request to the server, the data must be HTTP encoded. Special characters like blanks, ">" signs, and so on, are replaced by "%xx". For example, space is encoded as "%20".</p><p>This encoding can be performance heavy for large data, so WebLOAD Recorder enables you to turn it off.</p><p>This should ONLY be done if you are sure that the data does not contain special characters. If it does, and the customer wants to improve performance via this flag, then you should replace the special characters within the script or use wlHttp.EncodeFormdata to set the flag for specific requests.</p>|
|**Accept language**|Sets the wlGlobals.AcceptLanguage flag. This flag defines a global value for the "Accept-Language" header which will be sent with each request. Some applications/servers will behave differently depending on the setting. It is a simple string and WebLOAD Recorder does not enforce any checks on the values. It is similar to the property in the sense that it is a wlGlobals/wlHttp setting that affects the value of request headers.|



### **Setting the Browser Cache**
WebLOAD Recorder enables you to define the behavior of the cache that WebLOAD Console uses in order to simulate the behavior of a browser’s cache. WebLOAD can cache JavaScript files, style sheets, images, applets, and XML files.



**To define the browser cache behavior:**

1. Click **Default/Current Project Options** in the **Tools** tab of the ribbon. The Default/Current Project Options dialog box opens.
1. Select the **Browser Cache** tab.

|**Field**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|*Browser cache types*||
|**None**|All Virtual Clients simulate a browser with no available cache.|
|**Clear cache after each Request**|Defines that the cache will be cleared after each request.|
|**Check for newer version after each Request**|<p>Defines that WebLOAD will check for a newer version of the cached item after every request.</p><p>Whenever the engine has a request for a cached resource, the engine sends the request with an "if-modified-since" header. If the server responds with a 200 status, the engine will refresh the cache.</p>|
|**Clear cache after each Round**|Defines that the cache will be cleared after each script execution round. This is the default setting.|
|**Check for newer version after each Round**|<p>Defines that WebLOAD will check for a newer version of the cached item after each round.</p><p>Whenever the engine has a request for a cached resource, the engine sends the request with an "if-modified-since" header. If the server responds with a 200 status, the engine will refresh the cache.</p>|
|**Never clear cache**|Defines that the cache will never be cleared. Each client maintains its own cache.|
|*Cache content*|<p>You can select a filter, enabling you to indicate specific content types to be cached in the script. The available filters are:</p><p>- JavaScript files</p><p>- Style sheets</p><p>- Images</p><p>- Applets</p><p>- XML files</p><p>- Dynamic</p>|





### Configuring Authentication Settings
WebLOAD Recorder enables you to define the global and proxy authentication settings.

WebLOAD Recorder enables you to configure a double proxy configuration, which instructs the recorder to use two application proxies, one for regular HTTP traffic and another for secure (SSL) traffic. To configure the two proxies, see [*Configuring a Double Proxy* ](#configuring-a-double-proxy)*.

**To configure Authentication settings:**

#### Enabling Syntax Checking

Enable syntax checking to perform the following tests on a script while it is running.



|**Test**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|**Type Inspection**|<p>WebLOAD Recorder checks that each property receives the correct type. For example, wlLocals.ParseForms = 14 prompts the following log message:</p><p>"Wrong type for the property ParseForms. The correct type is Boolean. Legal values are: "Yes"/"No" or "true"/"false".</p>|
|**Value Inspections**|<p>WebLOAD Recorder checks to ensure that each property is assigned a legal value. For example, wlHttp.Version = "2.1" prompts the following log message:</p><p>"2.1 is an illegal value for the property Version. Legal values are: 1.0, 1.1."</p>|
|**Scope Inspections**|<p>WebLOAD Recorder checks to ensure that each property is assigned a permitted scope. For example, wlLocals.ConnectionSpeed = 28800 prompts the following log message:</p><p>"The property ConnectionSpeed is not valid for the object wlLocals."</p>|
|**Case Inspections**|<p>WebLOAD Recorder objects and properties are case sensitive. When syntax checking is enabled, WebLOAD Recorder checks to ensure that all objects and properties are written correctly. For example, wlLocals.parse = "No" prompts the following message:</p><p>"The property parse should be written Parse."</p>|




We recommend that syntax checking be run at least once while developing a script.

**To enable syntax checking:**

1. Click **Default/Current Project Options** in the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.

1. Select the **Diagnostic** tab.

1. Click **OK**.

The following table describes the options in the Script Generation tab.

|**HTTP Object**|**Description**|**Example**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Generate Authentication**|<p>Generates the name and password that appear in the header of a request.</p><p>This option is selected by default.</p>|wlHttp.UserName="John" wlHttp.Password="Blue"|
|**Generate proxy**|<p>Generates the proxy setting.</p><p>This option is selected by default.</p>|wlHttp.Proxy=<*ProxyName*>.<*ProxyPort*>|
|**Generate proxy authentication**|<p>Generates the name and password used to identify you to the proxy.</p><p>This option is selected by default.</p>|wlHttp.ProxyUserName=<*UserName*> wlHttp.ProxyPassword=<*Password*>|
|**Decode query string**|Records the query string that is the part of the URL after the "?" sign and is used for sending parameters for the specific server item which is targeted by this URL.|<p>When this option is not selected, the GET command will displayed as follows:</p><p>[wlHttp.Get("http://localhost/netizenba](http://localhost/netizenba) nk/myAccountWelcome.asp?netizenSID=313 41549426&ssn=1234&password=1231&I1.x=2 1&I1.y=10")</p><p>That is all the parameters that will appear as part of the URL.</p><p>When this option is selected, the URL will be parsed and displayed as follows:</p><p>wlHttp.FormData["netizenSID"] = "31341549618"</p><p>wlHttp.FormData["ssn"] = "124"</p><p>wlHttp.FormData["password"] = "3424"</p><p>wlHttp.FormData["I1.x"] = "29"</p><p>wlHttp.FormData["I1.y"] = "14"</p><p>[wlHttp.Get("http://localhost/netizenb](http://localhost/netizenba)a nk/myAccountWelcome.asp")</p><p>That is a block of parameters that will be easier to parameterize.</p>|
|**Generate redirection path**|WebLOAD Recorder records (in the script) only the first GET statement; the rest of the URLs visited when redirected are inserted into the script as comments. The script does not revisit all the URLs during playback.|<p>wlHttp.Get [("http://www.abcdef.com")](http://www.abcdef.com/)</p><p>// Redirections: [http://www.ghijkl.com, ](http://www.ghijkl.com/)etc.</p>|
|**Generate all headers**|<p>Generates **all** HTTP headers.</p><p>The headers</p><p>If-Modified-Since, If-None-Matched, and Keep Alive will be commented out to overcome the situation where recorded links were fetched from the browser’s</p><p>cache during the recording.</p><p>The request header Accept-Encode: gzip will also be commented out, to ensure correct behavior.</p><p>When Generate All Headers is selected, Generate Referer Header and Generate Custom Header are automatically checked and disabled so that they cannot be unchecked.</p>|<p>wlHttp.Header["user-agent"]</p><p>="Mozilla/4.04 [en] (WinNT; I)"</p><p>wlHttp.Header["accept-charset"] ="iso- 8859-1,\*,utf-8"</p><p>wlHttp.Header["proxy-connection"]</p><p>="Keep-Alive"</p><p>wlHttp.Header["accept-language"] ="en"</p>|
|**Generate referer header**|<p>Generates the referer header only. This header tells the server which URL submitted the request. For example, if you click a link from page xxx, the browser will send that url as the referer.</p><p>This option is selected by default.</p><p>This option is automatically selected and cannot be changed when Generate All Headers is selected.</p>|wlHttp.Header["Referer"] = ["http://www.easycar.com/"](http://www.easycar.com/)|
|**Generate custom headers**|Generates any headers that are not explicitly defined in the RFC, such as the SOAP Action header. This option is selected by default.||
|**Comment status**|Writes a comment about the status of your transactions (that is, any GET statement), including information about the contents of the pages.|<p>[wlHttp.Get("http://www.RadView.com/")](http://www.RadView.com/)</p><p>//200 OK</p>|
|**Comment request headers**|Writes a comment for each HTTP request.|<p>// Request Headers:</p><p>// user-agent=Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT)</p><p>// accept-encoding=gzip, deflate</p><p>// proxy-connection=Keep-Alive</p>|
|**Comment response headers**|Writes a comment for each reply to HTTP request.|<p>// Response Headers:</p><p>// content-type=text/html</p><p>// server=Microsoft-IIS/4.0</p><p>// date=Thu, 06 Jan 2000 16:12:44 GMT</p><p>// via=1.1 localhost (Jigsaw/1.0a5)//</p><p>200 OK</p>|
|**Encode binary data**|Used to specify if the binary data should be encoded. By default this flag is not selected.|<p>If a mobile operator wants to simulate the sending of binary data from the browser (phone) to the server. Part of the binary data is a value (for example, phone number) that needs parameterization.</p><p>When the EncodeBinaryData flag is selected, the binary form data "x0Ax0BAMIRx00" appears as "%0A%0BAMIR%00" in the script.</p>|
|**Generate**  **VIEWSTATE data**|Enables filtering the  VIEWSTATE  data while  recording.  When this is not  selected,  VIEWSTATE data  will be  commented out in  the script.||
|**Save all redirection headers**|Records the headers for all  URL redirections.||
|Generate Client side Cookies|When unchecked, the web  page sets  cookies from the  JavaScript  and you must  implement  the cookies  manually in  the script.  If selected, the cookies from  the headers  are compared  to cookies  that the server  sends. If  there is a  difference,  the correct  SetCookie  command is  added to  the script.

### Setting the WebLOAD Recorder to Record Post Data Types

Use the Post Data tab in the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box to instruct the WebLOAD Recorder how to treat different data types when it is recording. Data can be written in the script as part of the command, as a data block, or in a data file. A data block is stored within the script itself, and is useful when you prefer to see the data directly. A data file stores the data in a local text file, and is useful when you are working with large amounts of data which would be too cumbersome to store within the script code itself, or binary data. When working with data files, only the name of the text file is stored in the script itself. Data can also be recorded as FormData, in which the data is formatted in a tidy name-value format and is

url-encoded when sent to the server.

While recording a script, WebLOAD automatically identifies if there are no name-value pairs, checks if there is a valid content type (for example, text/plain), and records it accordingly (for example, as Data).

> **Note:** The content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded (with or without a charset), should always be recorded as FORMDATA, unless you explicitly specify to record it as DATA or DATA FILE.



**To set the WebLOAD Recorder to record data types:**

1. Click **Recording and Script Generation Options** in the **Tools** tab of the ribbon. 

    Or- 

    Select **Recording and Script Generation Options** from the WebLOAD Recorder **Home** tab of the ribbon.

    The Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box appears (see [Figure](#recording_and_script_generation)).

1. Select the **Post Data** tab. The Post Data tab moves to the front of the dialog box.

    ![Post Data Tab](../images/post_data.png)

1. Fill in the fields as described in table below.

1. Optionally, you can double-click an item from the DATA block or DATAFILE block lists to display the item’s full text.

    ![Post Data Full Text Message Box](../images/post_data_mess.png)

   

1. Click **OK** to return to the Post Data tab.

1. Click **OK** to save the record options settings.




The following table defines all the fields and options in the Post Data tab.

|**Field**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|**DATA block**|Lists the types of data that the WebLOAD Recorder records as DATA blocks in the script’s JavaScript. A DATA block is recorded without HTTP encoding and is not structured. During playback, the WebLOAD Recorder makes this data into form data and sends it without any further modification. A DATA block is for posting data that is not meant to be HTTP encoded, for example Web service calls.|
|**DATAFILE block**|Lists the types of data that the WebLOAD Recorder records as DATAFILE blocks (files with a name and a path). A DATAFILE block can store text and binary data. During playback, the WebLOAD Recorder copies and then sends this file with multipart form data, using a MIME protocol.|
|**Remove**|Click this button to delete a selected DATA block or DATAFILE block from both lists.|
|**Add new type**|Type the name of a new type you want to be added to either of the lists.|
|**As DATAFILE**|Adds the new type you entered in the Add new type field to the DATAFILE block list.|
|**As DATA**|Adds the new type you entered in the Add new type field to the DATA block list.|
|**Record Unknown Post Types as**|<p>Select to instruct the WebLOAD Recorder to record any data type not defined on this tab as:</p><p>- FORMDATA</p><p>- DATA</p><p>- DATAFILE</p>|

By default, the following content types are recorded as DATA blocks:

 - application/json; charset=utf-8
 - application/json-rpc
 - application/xml; charset=utf-8
 - text/xml
 - text/xml; charset=utf-8

> **Note:** The recorder searches for exact content types from this list. Therefore, text/xml and text/xml; charset=utf-8 are different content types even though the former is a subset of the latter.




WebLOAD Recorder deals specially with the following content types:

- multipart/form-data – This content type is used for uploading files. The actual content type sent by the client is multipart/form-data;boundary=long- string. The recorder searches for the multipart/form-data content type and then records the request as a From Data, although it appears in the DATAFILE block list.
- multipart/text – This content type is similar to multipart/form-data, except that the multipart/text content type is not used for uploading files. The multipart/text content type is therefore handled as a DATA block, but since it contains a variable in the name (the value of boundary in multipart/text;boundary= …), the treatment of this content type is hard- coded. For example, any content type that starts with multipart/text is recorded as a DATA block content type.
- soap messages – This content type is always recorded as DATA blocks.

Each rule is given a score during auto-discover correlation according to an algorithm that calculates the chances of the rule being used. Specify the filter strength as follows:</p><p>- Strict (few records) – Display only the rules that are very likely to be used in the script. This leads to faster script execution, but also has a high risk of missing a necessary rule.</p><p>- Normal (balanced) – Displays rules that are likely to be used in the script. This leads to average script execution, includes most (if not all) of the necessary rules and displays some rules that are not used.</p><p>- Weak (many records) – Display rules that have a chance of being used in the script. This leads to slower script execution and displays many rules that are not used.</p>|
|**Value delimiters**|<p>Specify the characters to be considered delimiters when searching for a dynamic value during correlation. The correlation engine searches for the dynamic value in the script, where the value is surrounded by a specific delimiter.</p><p>For example, in:</p><p>SessionID=1234&Day</p><p>’&’ is a delimiter, which defines ‘1234’ and ‘Day’ as two separate strings.</p>|
|**Show correlation review form**|<p>Specify when to show the Correlation Review form after performing correlation.</p><p>Possible values:</p><p>- Never.</p><p>- Always.</p><p>- After Auto-discovery.</p>|

### Setting the Proxy Options
Use the Proxy Options tab in the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box to designate the proxy server at your organization as the *application proxy* during recording sessions or to change the proxy port number for WebLOAD Recorder.

When you record scripts with the WebLOAD Recorder, your browser must be configured to use proxy port 9884 (which is the default proxy port). In other words, you must record scripts through proxy port 9884.

WebLOAD Recorder enables you to configure a double proxy configuration, which instructs the recorder to use two application proxies, one for regular HTTP traffic and another for secure (SSL) traffic. To configure the double proxy, see [*Configuring a Double Proxy* ](#configuring-a-double-proxy)*.

**To set the proxy options:**

1. Click **Recording and Script Generation Options** in the **Tools** tab of the ribbon.

    Or- 
 
    Select **Recording and Script Generation Options** from the WebLOAD Recorder **Home** tab of the ribbon.

|*User Authentication*||
|**User Name**|The user name used for user authentication purposes.|
|**Password**|The password used for user authentication purposes.|





#### Configuring a Double Proxy

A double proxy configuration is a way to instruct the recorder to use two application proxies: one for non-secure HTTP traffic and one for SSL traffic. When you define only an HTTP proxy as the application proxy in the Proxy Options tab in the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, the recorder uses the same definition for both traffic types.

In order to instruct the recorder to use a separate proxy for secured HTTP traffic, define the SSL Proxy and Port values.

WebLOAD Recorder also enables you to set authentication information for accessing the proxy. In the SSL proxy configuration, the User Name and Password values (in the Proxy Authentication frame) are used for both HTTP and SSL proxies. In order to set different authentication information for the SSL proxy, add the following lines to wlproxyinclude.js (which can be found in the WebLOAD include directory):

`ProxyObject.RSecondarySSLProxyUserName = "radview" `

`ProxyObject.RSecondarySSLProxyPassword="rad1"`

Finally, using this configuration will generate JavaScript code to indicate to the playback engine that it needs to use two proxies:

`wlHttp.UseSameProxyForSSL = false`

`wlHttp.HttpProxy = wlHttp.HttpsProxy =`

The engine will fit the relevant proxy to the request.

### Setting the Proxy Certificates

    - ProxyNTPassWord
    - ProxyPassWord
    - HttpsProxyPassWord
    - PassWord
    - NTPassWord
    - Form passwords – Password fields in form data. These can vary, depending on the form. You can list the names of the passwords fields whose contents you wish to encrypt.

In the JavaScript code, the encrypted password is replaced with a ‘decrypt’ statement for the encrypted value, as shown in the following example:

## Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar

You can use the **Customize Quick Access Toolbar** option in the Quick Access toolbar to customize the Quick Access toolbar.



## Configuring the Parameterization Manager

The Parameterization Manager enables you to edit a script containing static values and transform it into a script that will run multiple variations of the static values.

When recording a script, WebLOAD captures the data that is being sent, including login details, user selections, and entered text. When running the script under load, simulating many users, it is desirable to use variations in the data, so as to simulate the



application more realistically. To do so, you can replace the static values with parameters.

Parameter values can come from a file, or be automatically generated numbers, strings and dates.

The Parameterization Manager enables you to specify how the script should select values from the data file. For example:

- Order considerations – Whether to randomly select values from the data file, or use them in the order they appear.
- Uniqueness considerations – Whether the same value can be used at the same time by different virtual clients.

You can also specify the update policy, which defines when a new value will be read or calculated. For example, whether to update the value on each round, or once at the beginning of the test.

### Opening the Parameterization Manager

**To open the Parameterization Manager dialog box:**

- Click **Parameterization Manager** in the **Home** tab of the ribbon. The Parameterization Manager dialog box opens.

<a name = "parameterization_manager_dialog_box_a"></a>

| :- | :- |
|*Select Input File*||
|**File Name**|Enables selecting the data file. Click ![](../images/change_button.jpeg) to select a data file.|
|File Delimiter**|The character separating the fields in each row of the data file.|
|**Create New Data File**|<p>Enables creating a new data file. For information, see [*Creating a Data File*](#creating-a-data-file)</p><p>.</p>|
|*Select access method*|Defines the method for reading the next value/row from the file. The predefined methods are the most common and useful methods.|
|**Use values from the file**|<p>Use rows from the file without any specific restrictions. This is the recommended method to use when applicable.</p><p>This method corresponds to the following Custom settings: Scope – *local*, Order – *random*, When Out of Values – *cycle*.</p><p>For the explanations of Scope, Order and When Out of Values, see the explanations of the **Custom (Advanced)** option.</p>|
|**Use values, ensure that virtual clients do not use the same value at the same time**|<p>Use unique rows from the file so that a row cannot be used by two virtual clients at the same time. This is useful for example if the value is the login name, and the system under test does not allow the same user to be logged in twice.</p><p>This method corresponds to the following Custom settings:</p><p>Scope – *global unique*, Order – *random*, When Out of Values – *cycle*.</p><p>For the explanations of Scope, Order and When Out of Values, see the explanations of the **Custom (Advanced)** option.</p>|
|**Use all values once and stop the virtual clients**|<p>Use each row once. When all rows have been used, the virtual clients will be stopped.</p><p>This method corresponds to the following Custom settings:</p><p>Scope – *global unique*, Order – *random*, When Out of Values – *stop virtual client*.</p><p>For the explanations of the Scope, Order and When Out of Values parameters, see the explanations of the **Custom (Advanced)** option.</p>|
|**Custom (Advanced)**|Enables selecting any combination of Scope, Order and When Out of Value settings.|
|**Scope**|<p>Defines the scope (sharing policy) of values.</p><p>- **Local** – Each virtual client reads rows from its own copy of the pool.</p><p>- **Global unique** – All virtual clients read a unique row from a global pool, which is shared by all virtual clients on all load generators. A row cannot be used by two virtual clients at the same time.</p><p>- **Global** – All virtual clients in the session read rows from the shared (global) pool. However, the rows are not necessarily unique – two virtual clients may happen to use the same row at the same time. Note that if you select Global, there is not much point in enforcing order on the values because all virtual clients run at the same time, so it is not possible to read the values efficiently in a certain order. Therefore, specify Random or Not-ordered in the **Order** field.</p>|
|**Order**|<p>Defines the method for reading the next row from the file:</p><p>- **Random** – Every virtual client gets a random row from the file. All available rows have the same probability of being selected at any given point.</p><p>- **Not Ordered** – Every virtual client gets a random row from among the rows that have been used less times. Over time, all rows are used approximately the same number of times.</p><p>- **Ordered** – Every virtual client gets the next row from the file (sequential order). If necessary, the file is read through many times. Select this option only if sequential order is crucial for the application. When running more than one virtual client concurrently, the order of execution is anyway not defined, therefore this option is discouraged.</p><p></p><p>Note that specifying *Ordered* in conjunction with a *Global* or *Global Unique* Scope and *Cycle* When Out of Values, has unavoidable performance costs.</p>|
|**When out of values**|<p>Defines whether the rows can be used any number of times, or only once.</p><p>- **Cycle values** – Each row can be used any number of times.</p><p>- **Stop virtual client** – After each row was used once, stop any virtual client that requests another row. An error message is written to the monitor log window.</p><p>- **Keep last value** – After each row was used once, keep re-using the last value.</p>|
|*Update Policy*|<p>Defines when a parameter is updated, meaning when a new row is read.</p><p>- **Update value on each Round** – A virtual client reads a new row from the file per round. Thus, if the same parameter appears again in the same round, it will get the same value.</p><p>- **Update value on each use** – A virtual client reads a parameter’s row each time it is used.</p><p>- **Update value per Virtual Client** – A virtual clients reads a new row from the file when initialized (when running the InitClient function). All usage of a parameter by that virtual client will always use the same value.</p>|
|<p>**Show all file rows /**</p><p>**Show first 10 rows only**</p>|Determines which rows the grid displays.|
|**Use first row as title row**|Uses the first row of the file as the title row. If you select this option, the values of the first row are not used as data but as parameter names. For further explanations, refer to [*Inserting User-Defined Parameters in a Script*](#inserting-user-defined-parameters-in-a-script) .|

> **Note:** Using a random string parameter in a script does not provide unique values. If you need unique values, or special formatting of the string, create a data file with unique values and use File parameterization (see [*Defining a Data File* ](#defining-a-data-file)).



### Inserting User-Defined Parameters in a Script
WebLOAD Recorder enables you to edit parameters having static values and replace the static values with a call to a set of specified values. During runtime, the script runs the parameter using values from the set.

The first step is to use the Parameterization Manager to define the set of values (see [*Configuring the Parameterization Manager* ](#configuring-the-parameterization-manager)*)*. The set of values is a type of parameter (Number parameter, String parameter, Date/Time parameter or Data File parameter). The second step, described in this section, is to replace a static value in the script with a call to the defined parameter.

**To insert a user-defined parameter in a script:**

1. In the main window, click **Open** in the **File** tab of the ribbon, and open the script you want to edit.

1. In the JavaScript View pane, select the static value you want to replace. For example, in the line : 

    `wlHttp.FormData["name"] = "john"` 

    `select "John".`

1. Right-click and select **Insert Variable**.
 
    The Insert Variable menu appears, see ([Figure](../scripting/programming_your_javascript.md#insert_variable_menu)).

1. Select the parameter you defined in the Parameterization Manager.

    The selected parameter replaces the static value in the script. In our example, if you selected Users\_firstname.getValue()from the Insert Variable menu, the line now shows:

    `wlHttp.FormData["name"] = Users\_firstname.getValue();`

    Note that if you are using a parameter from a data file, the parameter name reflects whether the data file includes a title row.

       - If the data file includes a title row, the parameter name is of type:
          `{Parameter name}\_{column title}.getValue().`

       - If the data file does not include a title row, the column number is used, and the parameter name is of type:
          `{Parameter name}\_Col{column number}.getValue()`

> **Note:** To replace multiple occurrences of a static value, you can use the **Edit > Replace** tool.



#### Example of Using User-Defined Parameters in a Script

If the original recorded script includes:

`wlHttp.FormData["first\_name"] = "John"`

`wlHttp.FormData["last\_name"] = "Smith"`

`wlHttp.FormData["age"] = "47"`

and you wish to replace the static values (John, Smith, 47) with parameters, you can define a random number parameter ‘Age’, and a file parameter that calls the ‘Users’ data file having columns ‘firstName’ and ‘lastName’.

Using the Insert Variable menu, modify the script as follows:

`wlHttp.FormData["first\_name"] = Users\_firstName.getValue();` 

`wlHttp.FormData["last\_name"] = Users\_lastName.getValue();` 

`wlHttp.FormData["age"] = Age.getValue();`
