| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| doctype            | A read-only property that  gets the node for the DTD specified for the document. If no DTD was  specified, null is returned. |
| documentElement    | A read/write property that  gets/sets the root node of the document. |
| implementation     | A read-only property that  returns the implementation interface for this document. |
| parseError         | A read-only property that  provides an object that summarizes the last parsing error encountered. |
| preserveWhitespace | A read-write property that informs the  parser whether the default mode of processing is to preserve whitespace or  not. The default value of this property is false. |
| readyState         | A read-only property  indicating the status of instantiating the XML processor and document  download. The value of the  readyState property is summarized in the table. |
| resolveExternals   | A read-write property that informs the parser that  resolvable namespaces (a namespaces URI that begin with an “x- schema:” prefix), DTD external  subsets, and external entity references should be resolved at parse time. |
| url                | A read-only property that returns the  canonicalized URL for the XML document specified in the last call to load(). |
| validateOnParse    | A read/write property that  turns validation on at parse time if the value of `bool` is true, off if `validate` is false. |

## Node Interface Methods

| **Method**                                  | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| appendChild(newChild)                       | A method to append `newChild` as the last child of this node.  |
| cloneNode(deep)                             | A method to create a new  node that is an exact clone (same name, same attributes) as this node. When  deep is false, only the node and attributes without its children are cloned.  When deep is true, the node and all its descendants are cloned. |
| hasChildNodes()                             | A method that indicates  whether the node has children.      |
| InsertBefore  (newChild, oldChild)          | A method to insert `newChild`  as a child of  this node. `oldChild` is returned. oldNode must  be a child node of the element, otherwise an error is returned. If `newChild`  is null, the `oldChild`  is removed. |
| removeChild(child)                          | A method to remove a childNode from a node. If childNode is not a child of the  node, an error is returned. |
| ReplaceChild  (newChild, oldChild)          | A method to replace `oldChild` with `newChild` as a child of this node. |
| selectNodes(query)                          | Returns a `NodeList` containing the results of  the query indicated by query, using the current node as the query context. If  no nodes match the query, an empty `NodeList` is returned. If there is an error in the query  string, the DOM error reporting is used. |
| SelectSingleNode  (query)                   | Returns a single node that  is the first node in the `NodeList` returned from the query,  using the current node as the query context. If no nodes match the query,  null is returned. If there is an error in the query string, an error is  returned. |
| TransformNode (stylesheetDOMNode)           | Returns the results of  processing the source `DOMNode` and its children with the  stylesheet indicated by `stylesheetDOMNode`. The source defines the  entire context on which the stylesheet operates, so ancestor or id navigation  outside of the scope is not allowed. The stylesheet parameter must be either  a DOM Document node, in which case the document is assumed to be an ASL stylesheet,  or a DOM Node in the xsl namespace, in which case this node is treated as a standalone. |
| TransformNodeToObject  (stylesheet, Object) | Sends the results of the transform to the  requested object, either in `IStream` or a DOM Document. |



 



## Node List Interface

| **Property** | **Description**                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| length       | The number of nodes in the  `NodeList`. The length of the list will change dynamically as children or  attributes are added/deleted from the element. |
| nextNode     | Returns the next node in  the `NodeList` based  on the current node. |
| item(index)  | Returns the node in the `NodeList` with the specified index.   |
| reset()      | Returns the iterator to the uninstantiated  state; that is, before the first node in the `NodeList`. |



## NamedNodeMap Interface

| **Property**                                  | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| length                                        | The number of nodes in the  `NamedNodeMap`. The length of the list will change dynamically  as children or attributes are added/deleted from the element. |
| getNamedItem(name)                            | Returns the node  corresponding to the attribute with name. If name is not an attribute, null  is returned. |
| GetQualifiedItem  (baseName, namespaceURI)    | Allows the specification  of a qualifying `namespaceURI` to access a namespace  qualified attribute. It returns the node corresponding to the attribute with baseName  in the  namespace specified by `nameSpaceURI`. If the qualified name (`baseName+nameSpaceURI`) is not an attribute,  null is returned. |
| item(index)                                   | Returns the node in the `NameNodeMap`  with the  specified index. If the index is greater than the total number of nodes, null  is returned. If the index is less than zero, null is returned. |
| nextnode()                                    | Returns the next node in  the `NodeList` based  on the current node. |
| RemovedNamedItem (name)                       | Removes the attribute node  corresponding to name and returns the node. If name is not an attribute, null  is returned. |
| RemoveQualifiedItem (basename, namespaceURI) | Removes the `nameSpaceURI`  qualified  attribute node corresponding to `baseName` and returns the node. If the qualified name is not  an attribute, null is returned. |
| reset()                                       | Returns the iterator to  the uninstantiated state; that is before the first node in the `NodeList`. |
| SetNamedItem (namedItem)                      | Adds the attribute `Node` to the list.  If an attribute already exists with the same name as that specified by `nodeName` of `DOMNode`, the attribute is  replaced and the node is returned. Otherwise, Node is returned. |
|                                               |                                                              |

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| errorcode | Returns the error code number in decimal.                    |
| filepos   | Returns the absolute file  position where the error occurred. |
| line      | Returns number of the line containing the  error.            |
| linepos   | Returns the character  position where the error occurred.    |
| reason    | Returns the reason for the error.                            |
| srcText   | Returns the full text of the line  containing the error.     |
| url       | Returns the URL of the XML  file containing the error.       |

 



## Implementation Interface
