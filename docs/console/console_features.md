# WebLOAD Console Features

The WebLOAD Console is where you perform the majority of your load / performance testing activities.

## The WebLOAD Console

The Console consists of the following:

- Console System button
- Quick Access toolbar
- Ribbon
- Session Tree
- Results window
- Status bar

The Console manages the Load Session. It also:

- Configures Load Session hosts and scripts.
- Schedules Load Session scripts.
- Monitors the application’s performance and integrity under the generated load.
- Manages the Load Session as it is running, allowing you to pause, stop and continue Load Session components as needed.
- Displays the current performance of the SUT and provides a final performance report for Virtual Clients and Probing Clients.
- Manages exporting of test reports.

The WebLOAD Console component controls your test session. From the Console, you can:

- Specify the program (script) that the test session runs.
- Select the number of Virtual Clients to run.
- Define the hosts participating in the Load Session.
- Schedule tests.
- View performance reports.

### Opening the Console

**To open the Console:**

- Select **Start** > **All Programs** > **RadView** > **WebLOAD** > **WebLOAD Console**,

  -Or-

  From your desktop, click the **Console** icon.

  The WebLOAD Console Startup dialog box appears, displaying a variety of shortcuts to the various WebLOAD Console components. After you select an option and start working, the WebLOAD main screen appears.

The Console is operated through its Console System button and ribbon at the top of the screen. Tests are configured through a series of dialog boxes.

## Console Elements

When you first start WebLOAD Console, you see the Console window interface in Edit mode. The Console window displays different components in the two different modes:

- Edit Mode where you create your templates.
- Run Mode where you run your sessions and see the results. The Console window interface consists of the following elements.

### Title Bar

The title bar displays the name and path of the current template or session.

### Console System Button

The Console System button provides access to the most commonly used tasks.

### Quick Access Toolbar

The Quick Access toolbar provides shortcuts for your most common tasks. By default, the toolbar provides shortcuts to the Save, Open and Start Session commands. You can customize the toolbar to add any other WebLOAD Console command.

![Quick Access Toolbar](../images/console_users_guide_0061.jpeg)

### Ribbon

The ribbon displays the commands you use to work with WebLOAD Console. In addition to the standard File tab, various tabs are provided to access functions specific to template creation and session management, such as the Session tab.

![](../images/console_ribbon.png) 

### Right-click Menus

The right-click menus provide shortcuts to frequently performed actions.

The specific list of shortcuts available depends on the area where you click the right mouse button.

For example, the right-click menu displayed when you right-click the Load Session icon in the Session Tree in edit mode enables you to:

- Open the WebLOAD Wizard.
- Modify script selections.
- Delete the Load Template.
- Access the default and current session options.
- Access the SLA Manager.

## Status Bar

At the bottom of the Console window, the status bar displays information about operations in progress.

While a session is running, the status bar displays continually updated information about the Elapsed time since the session started running, and the Remaining time till session end (if known).

## The Session Tree

The Session Tree displays in the left pane of the Console screen, and gives you a complete graphical overview of the test session including the scripts run, and the hosts running each script. The icons adjacent to the tree items enable you to view your test activity at a glance.

![](../images/console_users_guide_0063.png)

![Session Tree](../images/console_users_guide_0064.png)

During the test configuration phase, the Session Tree is a convenient interface for editing the test session. Clicking the **WebLOAD Wizard** icon in the Home tab of the ribbon starts the WebLOAD Wizard. Double-clicking a tree node opens the dialog box for configuring that tree item. Right-clicking a tree item prompts a menu that enables you to perform a number of functions on the test session. As you change your configuration through the Console configuration dialog boxes, the changes that you make are reflected in the Session Tree.

While your test session is running, the Session Tree displays its progress. The Session Tree displays the scripts configured for running, the participants in the test, and their status. For more information on the status of the test, see [*Status Icons* ](#status-icons).

#### The Session Tree Structure

- The "root" of the tree, in the upper-most line, displays the Load Session icon.
- The first level branches display the scripts to be run during the test session. The scripts may be single scripts or a Mix of scripts. The icons displayed next to the script name indicate its status. For more information on the status of Session components, see [*Status Icons* ](#status-icons).
- The second level branches present the hosts participating in the test session. These hosts can be Load Machines or Probing Clients. A different icon represents each host type. The icons displayed adjacent to the hosts indicate their status. Several hosts can run the same script.

![Session Tree Structure](../images/console_users_guide_0065.jpeg)

#### Session Tree Icons

WebLOAD Console displays icons on each line of the Session Tree, making it easy to view your test elements and activity.

The Session Tree icons are described in the following table:

| **Icon**                                                      | **Session Component**                                                                    |

#### The Session Tree in Run Mode

The Session Tree displays the complete configuration of the current Load Session. Status icons reflect the status of your Load Session.

Through the Session Tree you can see:

- The scripts running in the test session.
- The hosts running each script.
- Each script and host’s current operating status.

Icons are displayed on each line of the tree, making it easy to view the test activity.

The Load Machine icon, along with its status (currently running), is followed by the host name (Windows7x64). </p><p> Two numbers follow each Load Machine entry: </p><p> - The first number is the maximum load that Mix schedules it to generate over the course of a test session. </p><p> - The second number is the current load being generated. </p><p> In this example, Windows7x64is running under Mix1, and has a maximum scheduled load of 100 Virtual Clients and is currently generating a load of 100 Virtual Clients. </p>                                                                                |

To the right of each Load Machine two numbers are displayed in parentheses, for example, sharony (25, 45). These display the load size currently being generated; followed by the maximum load size (number of Virtual Clients) the script is scheduled to generate. The current load size number will change according to the load schedule defined in the Schedule dialog box. Before a test session begins, the ‘current’ load size being generated is 0. In most modes of operation, the current load size will never exceed the maximum load size scheduled for that Script listed to the right of the current value.

> **Note:** Using Throttle Control, you can increase the current load size to exceed the maximum load size - but not while running the Goal-Oriented Test Session.

In run mode you can right-click an item in the Session Tree to view the test parameters defined in the session.

| Load Session               | Opens a saved Load Session  (*.ls) including template data from a completed test. Enter the name of  the saved Load Session in the edit box. |

Use either the Goal-Oriented Test Wizard to develop a goal-seeking performance test or the WebLOAD Wizard to develop a basic Load Template. Both of these wizards enable you to save your test parameters as a template that you can later edit manually using the Console ribbon.

After developing a test with either of the wizards, you can save the test parameters as a Load Template. After running the test you can save the test parameters and results as a Load Session. You can then edit the test parameters by editing the Load Template or view the Load Session test results. For more information on Load Sessions and Load Templates, see [*Managing Load Templates and Load Sessions* ](manage_load_templates_sessions.md).

## Edit Mode and Run Modes of Operation

When you open a new test, WebLOAD Console is in Edit mode. In edit mode, you can edit the parameters of your test.

When you run your test, WebLOAD Console switches to Run mode. When in run mode, you cannot edit the parameters of the test.

If you are in Run mode and you wish to edit the test parameters, click the **Edit Template** ![](../images/console_users_guide_0105.jpeg) button in the Session tab of the ribbon to switch to edit mode.
