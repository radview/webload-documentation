# Performance Measurements Manager

WebLOAD Console provides the Performance Measurements Manager (PMM) for monitoring the performance of various server-side applications, databases, stream technology, system, and Web server measurements in real-time while your test is running.




## Using the Performance Measurements Manager

Using the PMM, you configure WebLOAD Console to collect data for the hosts and services available from the server, to provide a complete picture of application performance while you are testing your Web application. Thus, in addition to the data accumulated from load testing, you receive data on the performance of your server.

Using the PMM, you can monitor:

- Application Server Resources
- Database Resources
- Stream Technology Resources
- System Resources
- Web Server Resources



## About the Performance Measurements Manager

Using the PMM you can monitor a wide range or performance objects such as application data, database, Web server, stream technology, and system performance statistics in real-time during your test sessions. Each performance object, or data source, provides measurements that represent detailed data on specific aspects of the system or service.

Use the performance data collected to:

- Understand the effect of the load on your system’s resources.
- Observe changes in resource usage so you can plan for future upgrades.


- Test application changes by monitoring the results.
- Diagnose problems and target components or processes for optimization.

You set up the data sources to monitor in the PMM, including the hosts and measurements. You can maintain multiple configurations of servers, hosts and measurements to monitor.

Each configuration includes:

- Data sources
- Hosts
- Selected measurements from each data source on each host

To activate the monitors, you must configure the list of data sources, hosts and measurements to monitor before running your load test. While running your test, you can create Integrated Reports to display performance statistics for any monitors configured in the PMM. Use the PMM Wizard to add data sources to the PMM main window and create configuration files.

The PMM can be run from within WebLOAD Console or as a standalone tool. Run the PMM from within WebLOAD Console to create and define the performance objects to monitor and assign the configuration to a WebLOAD template, or run the standalone tool to create a library of configuration files for use in future WebLOAD tests.




## Opening the Performance Measurements Manager

The PMM can be opened as a standalone tool for configuring the data to monitor before you even define your test or from within WebLOAD Console to assign PMM configurations to your test template.

- To open the PMM from within WebLOAD Console, click **Performance Measurements Manager** in the **Session** tab of the ribbon.
- To open the PMM as a standalone tool select **Start** > **Programs** > **RadView** >**WebLOAD** > **Utilities** > **Performance Measurements Manager**.



The PMM opens with no configured data sources listed.

## Using PMM Configuration Files

PMM configuration files can be created and attached to WebLOAD Console templates for monitoring performance in a test session, or configured and saved for use in future WebLOAD Console sessions.

### Creating a New Configuration File

When PMM is first opened the main configuration window is empty, enabling you to create a new configuration file. For directions on how to define the components to monitor, see [*Specifying the Data Sources, Hosts, and Measurements to Monitor* ](#specifying-the-data-sources-hosts-and-measurements-to-monitor).

If the PMM currently displays a configuration file, creating a new configuration file requires clearing the current configuration information from the display window.



**To clear an existing configuration from the configuration window in order to define a new configuration file:**

1. Click the **New** ![](../images/console_users_guide_2109.png) toolbar button.

    A dialog box appears asking for confirmation.

1. Click **Yes**.

    The PMM configuration window is cleared.



### Opening / Importing Saved PMM Configuration Files

PMM configurations can either be opened alone, or they can also be added to any existing configuration in the PMM configuration window, letting you reuse existing configuration files within a new test configuration.

**To open an existing configuration file:**

1. #### **File** > **Import PMM**,
    -Or-

    Click the **Import** ![](../images/console_users_guide_2111.png) toolbar button.

    The Open dialog box opens for selecting an existing PMM configuration file.

### Enabling Database Monitoring

PMM enables you to monitor database servers during runtime. This allows you to view performance data from the database in real-time. Before running your test session, you may need to perform some configuration tasks, as described below.

> **Note:** No configuration is necessary if you are using the following database: Microsoft SQL server.

#### Oracle Monitor – Configuration Tasks on Windows

The PMM Oracle database monitor uses SNMP to retrieve statistics.

**To use this monitor on Windows you must:**

1. Install SNMP support for Windows.
1. Install SNMP support for Oracle using the Oracle Database installation.
1. Specify the port where the Oracle master agent is listening.

    The required port is specified in the TRANSPORT section of the MASTER.CFG file located in the \ADMIN directory.

    For example, add the following section to the MASTER.CFG file:

    `TRANSPORT ordinary SNMP`
     `OVER UDP SOCKET`
     `AT PORT 161`

    Use port 161 for the Oracle Peer SNMP master agent.

1. Specify the authentication in the `COMMUNITY` section of the `MASTER.CFG` file. For example:

      `COMMUNITY public` 
      
      `ALLOW ALL OPERATIONS` 
      
      `USE NO ENCRYPTION`

1. Specify an unused port where the encapsulated agent, such as Microsoft SNMP service, should listen. Microsoft SNMP service typically uses port 1161. The port is specified in the `SERVICES` file located in the `NT_HOME|\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC` directory.

      For example, modify the `nt_home\system32\drivers\etc\services` file from:

      …

      `snmp 161/udp`

      …

      To:

      `snmp 1161/udp`

1. Specify which non-PEER master agents are to be encapsulated by editing the encapsulator configuration file, ENCAPS.CFG, located in the \ADMIN directory. You must add the AGENT entry, including MIB-subtrees manageable by NMS, for the encapsulated master agent.

      For example, modify the `encaps.cfg` file as follows: 
      
      `AGENT AT PORT 1161 WITH COMMUNITY public` 
      `SUBTREES 1.3.6.1.2.1.1,`

      `1.3.6.1.2.1.2,`

      `1.3.6.1.2.1.3,`

      `1.3.6.1.2.1.4,`

      `1.3.6.1.2.1.5,`

      `1.3.6.1.2.1.6,`

      `1.3.6.1.2.1.7,`

      `1.3.6.1.2.1.8,`

      `1.3.6.1.4.1.77`

      `FORWARD ALL TRAPS;`

      > **Note:** The port (1161) must match the unused port specified in step 5.

1. Make the "OracleSNMPPeerEncapsulator" service automatic and start it.
1. Reboot your computer.



#### Oracle Monitor – Configuration Tasks on UNIX

The PMM Oracle database monitor uses an SNMP Master Agent to communicate with the Oracle Intelligent Agent. The SNMP Master Agent and the Oracle Intelligent Agent must be configured correctly before the Oracle Intelligent Agent can communicate over SNMP to the Master Agent on a UNIX platform. For detailed information on configuring the Intelligent Agent, see the *Oracle Enterprise Manager Configuration Guide*.

**To use this monitor on UNIX you must:**

1. Configure the SNMP Master Agent.
1. Start the SNMP Agents.

##### **Configuring the SNMP Master Agent**

The necessary SNMP files are installed automatically when you install the Oracle Intelligent Agent. After installing the Oracle Intelligent Agent, you will have to edit the following files as described below:

- `$ORACLE_HOME/network/snmp/peer/CONFIG.master`
- `$ORACLE_HOME/network/snmp/peer/CONFIG.encap`
- `$ORACLE_HOME/network/snmp/peer/start_peer`
- `/etc/snmpd.config`

###### CONFIG.Master (Peer Master Agent file)

**To edit the CONFIG.master file:**

- Find the line beginning with MANAGER and change the IP address coded in this line to match the IP address of the machine where the SNMP traps will be sent.

###### CONFIG.encap (Peer Encapsulator file

**To edit the CONFIG.encap file:**

- Find the line `AGENT AT PORT`. It normally reads `AGENT AT PORT 1161 WITH COMMUNITY public`.

If you modify the port number from 1161, you must also modify the `start_peer`

script.



###### start_peer Script

**To edit the start_peer script:**

1. Find the line `NEW_SNMPD_PORT=` and verify that it is using the same port number listed above in the CONFIG.encap file.
1. Find the line `NEW_TRAPD_PORT=` and verify the port number is different from

    `NEW_SNMPD_PORT=`.
   
   

###### snmpd.config File

**To edit the snmpd.config file:**

1. Add the following line to the file:

    `trap <hostname or ipaddress>`

1. Replace the information in angle brackets with the actual hostname or IP address of the local host where the file is located.



##### **Starting the SNMP Agents**

**To start the SNMP agents:**

1. Make sure no SNMP components are running. The three main components are the `master_peer`, `encap_peer`, and `snmpd`. If any of these processes are running, use the ps command to find them, and the kill command to terminate the processes.

    For example:

    `ps -ef | grep snmp`

    This command checks to see if the SNMP Master Agent is running.

1. Start the PEER Master Agent, PEER encapsulator, and native Digital UNIX SNMP Agent:

    `cd $ORACLE_HOME/network/snmp/peer`
   
    `su root`

    `./start_peer -a`

    This command starts all three processes.

1. Now use the ps command to verify that all three processes were started:

    `ps -aux |grep peer`
    
    `ps -aux |grep snmpd`
    
    `ps -ef | grep snmp`



#### MySQL database using SNMP – Configuration Tasks

For the Microsoft **SQL Server 2000**, enable SNMP monitoring by selecting the **Enable SNMP** check box in the SQL Server Network Utility dialog box.

Microsoft **SQL Server 2005** and **SQL Server 2008** do not support SNMP. Use the Windows Performance Monitor instead.

### Enabling Systems Monitoring

PMM enables you to monitor operating systems during runtime. This allows you to view performance data from the systems in real-time. Before running your test session, you may need to perform some configuration tasks, as described below.

> **Note:** No configuration is necessary if you are using the following systems: Windows .Net Framework, Windows platform.



### Enabling Web Servers Monitoring

PMM enables you to monitor Web servers during runtime to view performance data from the server in real-time. Before running your test session, you may need to perform some configuration tasks, as described below.

> **Note:** No configuration is necessary if you are using the following Web server: Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).

#### Apache Web Server Using SNMP – Configuration Tasks

The PMM uses SNMP to monitor different status values of the Apache Web server.

The Apache SNMP monitoring is based on Mod-Apache-Snmp. For download and installation instructions, refer to [http://mod-apache-](http://mod-apache-snmp.sourceforge.net/english/index.htm) [snmp.sourceforge.net/english/index.htm.](http://mod-apache-snmp.sourceforge.net/english/index.htm)

#### Apache 2 Web Server Using SNMP – Configuration Tasks

The PMM uses SNMP to monitor different status values of the Apache 2 Web server.



The Apache 2 SNMP monitoring is based on **Mod-Apache-Snmp**. For download and installation instructions, refer to [http://mod-apache-](http://mod-apache-snmp.sourceforge.net/english/index.htm) [snmp.sourceforge.net/english/index.htm.](http://mod-apache-snmp.sourceforge.net/english/index.htm)

#### Sun One (iPlanet) – Configuration Tasks

The PMM Sun One monitor uses SNMP to retrieve server statistics.

**To use this monitor you must:**

1. Install SNMP support for Windows.
1. Ensure that the iPlanet SNMP agent is installed and activated on the iPlanet server host.

    Configure the Sun One server to be a proxy for the SNMP agent.

1. Configure the Sun One server host to use port 1161 as the SNMP message port.
1. Enable **SNMP Statistics Collection** on the SNMP Subagent Configuration page of the Server Manager.

##### **Setting up the SNMP Agent and Configuring the Sun One Server as a Proxy for the SNMP Agent**

To enable PMM to monitor performance data from the Sun One application server you must first set up the Sun One SNMP agent. The Administration Interface will not start the OS master agent on ports other than 161. The workaround is to use the Sun One SNMP master agent, modify the native master agent to use a different port, and enable the Sun One SNMP subagent to gather information about the server.

**To set up the Sun One SNMP agent on Solaris:**

1. Check whether an SNMP daemon (snmpd) is running on port 161. If an SNMP daemon is running:
    1. Make sure you know how to restart it and which MIB it supports.
    1. Kill its process.
1. Edit the `CONFIG` file located in the `plugins/snmp/magt` server root directory from:

    …

    `snmp 161/udp`

    …

    To:
 
    …
   
    `snmp 1161/udp`
   
    …
 
1. Manually activate the Sun One master agent and subagent.

    1. At the command prompt, enter the commands:

       `cd <iws\_install>/Servers/plugins/snmp cd maget`

       `./magt CONFIG INIT& cd ../sagt`

       `./sagt -c CONFIG &`

   1. Restart the Sun One Server and the subagent from the Web server Administration.



## Enabling Monitoring of Application Servers that use Generic Monitoring Protocols

PMM enables you to monitor application servers that use generic monitoring protocols. You can monitor the application servers during runtime to view performance data in real-time. Before running your test session, you may need to perform some configuration tasks, as described below.

### General JMX – Configuration Tasks

The Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology provides the tools for building distributed, Web-based, modular and dynamic solutions for managing and monitoring devices, applications, and service-driven networks.

General JMX can connect to any device that supports JMX (JSR-003) and JMX Remote API (JSR-160). Refer to your application server’s documentation to see how to configure JMX for your server.

### General Performance Monitor – Configuration Tasks

General Performance Monitor can be used to connect and collect statistics using Windows Performance Monitor protocol (Perfmon).

When you connect to a host server using Perfmon (Windows), you must have administrator privileges on that server in order to successfully monitor it. For more information about configuring administrator privileges on a host server using Perfmon (Windows), see [*Configuring Administrator Privileges for Perfmon (Windows)* ](#configuring-administrator-privileges-for-perfmon-windows).

### General SNMP – Configuration Tasks

General SNMP can be used to connect to all servers supporting SNMP monitoring.

Refer to your server documentation for instructions on how to enable SNMP on your server.

### General UNIX – Configuration Tasks

RSTAT monitors enable you to monitor the **rpc.rstatd** daemon counters. This daemon is already installed and running on most Solaris and Linux machines. If not, you can obtain it at [http://rstatd.sourceforge.net/.](http://rstatd.sourceforge.net/)

This protocol uses RPC calls on port 111. You may need to open this port in the firewall to allow PMM to access the rstatd daemon.





## Monitoring Generic SNMP Data Sources

WebLOAD Console currently supports a variety of SNMP monitors by default, including basic SNMP for Windows, Solaris, and UNIX/Linux, along with WebLogic, and Oracle servers. WebLOAD Console’s SNMP monitoring support can be easily extended by updating WebLOAD Console’s UserMibFilter.ini file. For more information about extending SNMP monitoring support, see *PMM Extension* in the *WebLOAD Extensibility SDK*.





## Remote Performance Measurement Manager

This feature enables you to collect statistics on remote machines using TestTalk. With other methods of testing a remote machine, security and firewall issues may block communication between the WebLOAD Console and the remote machine. Using TestTalk to measure performance on remote machines avoids this problem.

To enable the Remote Performance Measurement Manager, you must add a special protocol extension to the Load Generator, called the Remote Machine Load Generator. This extension monitors the Windows Perfmon and sends the information back as Load Generator statistics.

Once the Remote Machine Load Generator is installed, you can add a Remote Performance Measurement Manager script to your template. When you run the template, statistics from the remote machine are gathered through the Remote Machine Load Generator and the script you configure.

## Setting the Remote Machine Load Generator

In order to collect statistics from a remote machine using the Remote Performance Measurement Manager, you must first add the Remote Machine Load Generator extension to your Load Generator. The following sections explain how to install the Remote Machine Load Generator extension.

#### Installing the Remote Machine Load Generator Extension

Install WebLOAD on any Windows machine that can access the server you want to probe. For more information, see the *WebLOAD Installation Guide.*

#### Setting INI Properties

Set the following parameters in `webload.ini` of the Load Generator installation

`(<Install Dir>\bin)`:

`PROTOCOLS="pmprobeprotocol.dll;JSCOMObject.dll"`

` PROTOCOLS_NAMES="Performance Monitor Probe;COM Object"`

##### Setting the Probed Measurements

You can run the Remote Performance Measurement Manager utility to select the servers you want to probe and the statistics you want to collect. For instructions on how to use the Performance Measurements Manager utility to select a server and statistics, see [*Specifying the Data Sources, Hosts, and Measurements to Monitor* ](#specifying-the-data-sources-hosts-and-measurements-to-monitor).



> **Note:** To use the Remote PMM , you must obtain a valid license file for the remote machine. To do so, open the Update License utility after performing a full WebLOAD installation, and send the HostID to [license@radview.com ](mailto:license@radview.com)with a request for a license for setting up a Remote PMM only.

**To select a server and statistics:**

1. From the Start menu, select **Start** > **Programs** > **<WebLOAD Installation>** > **Utilities** > **Performance Measurements Manager**, to select the servers you want to probe and the measurements that should be received.
1. Save the selected definitions in any file you choose, for example: `myload.pmm`.
1. Modify the `C:\Program Files\RadView\WebLOAD\bin\webload.ini` file, as follows:
    1. Locate the LOAD_PMM_FILE_PATH="" parameter.
    1. Insert the path and name of your selected definitions file. For example:

      `LOAD_PMM_FILE_PATH="C:\\temp\\myload.pmm"`

> **Note:** Currently, only the "Perfmon" measurements for probing Windows are supported when using the Remote PMM feature.

#### Firewall Settings

**To configure the firewall settings:**

- Open port 9000 in the firewall.

> **Note:** Port 9000 is the default port for TestTalk, WebLOAD Console’s network agent. You can change the port number through TestTalk’s configuration file.

**To change the default port:**

1. Open the C:\Program Files\RadView\WebLOAD\bin\webload.ini file.
1. Modify the following parameter value from "9000" to a different port number, for example: "9011:"

    `TESTTALK_NETWORK_PORT="9011".`

1. Save and close the file.
1. Exit TestTalk.
1. Restart WebLOAD Console.



### Setting the Console

Once you have installed and configured the Remote Machine Load Generator, you can add a Remote Performance Measurement Manager script to your template. This script is run by the Remote Machine Load Generator when you run your template.

**To add a Remote PMM script to the template:**

1. Click **Add Remote PMM** in the **Home** tab of the Console ribbon. The Add PMM Probing Client dialog box is displayed.

    ![Add PMM Probing Client Dialog Box](../images/console_users_guide_2143.png)

## Importing External Statistics

WebLOAD Console enables you to import statistical data from an external comma- delimited values file (.csv) into your report, while running a Load Session or upon test completion. Imported counters are added to the integrated reports tree, under Import::<File name>, where <File name> is the name of the file containing the external statistics. For more information about integrated reports, see [*WebLOAD Console Performance* Reports ](console_performance_reports.md). All imported data is integrated with the

Load Session’s database and the WebLOAD Console statistics are also calculated for this information. For more information about WebLOAD Console statistics, see [*WebLOAD Statistics Reports* ](statistics_reports.md).

> Note: Imported data is also available for use with WebLOAD Analytics.

#### **To import external statistics:**

1. Select **Import External Statistics** from the **Session** tab of the ribbon. The Import External Statistics dialog box appears.
