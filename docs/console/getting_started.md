# Getting Started

WebLOAD accurately simulates Internet users’ behavior and models real-life demands on your Web application to predict capacity requirements, report bottlenecks, and report weak links in your application before deployment.

This chapter introduces WebLOAD, the WebLOAD test components and an overview of WebLOAD’s capabilities and features.



## Welcome to WebLOAD

WebLOAD delivers the following for maximum testing performance, ease of use and value:

- Full client-side JavaScript support.
- Document Object Model (DOM) access.
- JavaScript-based test scripting.
- Seamless integration with Web application servers.
- Automated operation.
- Single-point management and real-time graphical and statistical reporting.

WebLOAD verifies the scalability and integrity of Web applications by generating a load composed of Virtual Clients that simulate real-world traffic. Probing Clients let you refine the testing process by acting as a single user that measures the performance of targeted activities, and provides individual performance statistics of the Web application under load.

- **WebLOAD is powerful.** WebLOAD unifies performance, scalability and integrity testing into a single process for accurate and timely verification of your Web application, under load defined conditions. WebLOAD provides you with unmatched flexibility for defining and parameterizing Virtual Clients such as connection speed, browser types, multithreading, and SSL encryption strength, for absolute control while simulating real-world conditions.
- **WebLOAD is easy to use.** Recording a test script is as easy as using a browser, with WebLOAD Recorder recording each step. WebLOAD Recorder requires no programming and is operated using an intuitive, graphical user interface to create visual scripts. These visual scripts can later be enhanced by modifying the automatically generated script. Scripts developed in WebLOAD Recorder can be run in WebLOAD to emulate Virtual Clients for load testing, or can be run in WebLOAD Console to emulate Virtual Clients for load testing.

- **WebLOAD is efficient.** WebLOAD delivers unmatched levels of load generation through its optimized architecture and use of operating systems. You can freely incorporate additional systems for virtually unlimited testing loads.
- **WebLOAD is simple.** WebLOAD automatically finds the performance threshold of your Web application through Goal-Oriented testing. Simply define target performance parameters and WebLOAD generates and increases the number of Virtual Clients accessing the application until performance levels can no longer be sustained.



## How Does WebLOAD Work?

WebLOAD tests Web applications by generating Virtual Clients that simulate real- world loads. Virtual Clients emulate the actions of human users by performing typical actions on your Web application. By increasing the number of Virtual Clients, you increase the load on the system. You create visual JavaScript-based test scripts that define the behavior of the Virtual Clients and WebLOAD executes these test scripts monitoring the application response graphically and statistically, and presenting the test results in real time.

WebLOAD incorporates functional verification into the scalability testing process allowing you to accurately verify the scalability and integrity of your Web applications at the per-client, per-transaction, and per-instance level under defined load conditions. WebLOAD saves the test results, including data from the Load Machines (described in the following paragraphs) and the hosting hardware’s performance monitor. You can view all or part of the data in real time, or after the test session is complete, in tabular format or in graphical format.

The WebLOAD test process includes:

1. Planning the test
1. Creating scripts
1. Creating Load Templates
1. Running the test
1. Analyzing the test results

This guide describes steps 1, 3, 4, and 5 in the test creation process in detail. Information on performing step 2, Creating scripts is available in the *WebLOAD Recorder User’s Guide*.




### WebLOAD Architecture
The following diagram illustrates the configuration for a typical WebLOAD test.

![Typical WebLOAD Architecture](../images/console_users_guide_0023.jpeg)



The *Console* sets up, runs and controls a test session. At the Console, you can:

- Define the hosts participating in the load test
- Specify the test scripts that the load test executes
- Schedule tests
- View performance reports

*Load Machines* are hosts, which run Load Generator software simulating multiple *Virtual Clients* simultaneously accessing your System Under Test (SUT). One Load Machine can run multiple Load Generators.

Load Generators execute tests that "bombard" the System Under Test with a large load, to enable complete scalability and stress testing.

The tests consist of multiple simultaneous requests made by Virtual Clients (which emulate Web browsers) to Web servers. Load Machines can run multiple threads.

The *System Under Test* (SUT) is where the Web system under test resides. The SUT does *not* require that WebLOAD software be installed on it.


The *Probing Client Machines* are also hosts. They run Probing Client software, which simulates a single Virtual Client accessing the SUT and runs at the same time as Load Machines, to further measure the performance of the SUT under load. WebLOAD returns exact values for Probing Client performance, in contrast to Load Machines, which return average values of Virtual Client performance*.*

Additional WebLOAD components are:

- **WebLOAD Recorder** – A tool for recording, creating, and authoring protocol test scripts for the WebLOAD environment. For more information, see the *WebLOAD Recorder User’s Guide*.
- **TestTalk** – A network agent that facilitates communication between the Console and hosts, either Load Machines or Probing Client Machines. TestTalk *must* be installed on both the Console and the hosts. TestTalk runs in the background and does not interfere with any other program running on your system.
- **WebLOAD Analytics** – enables you to generate a variety of reports based on performance data and statistics gathered by WebLOAD. Use WebLOAD Analytics to select a Load Session and generate predefined or custom reports displaying the results of the test.
- **WebRM –** distributes and circulates WebLOAD testing resources (Virtual Clients and Probing Clients) amongst users on a "need to use" basis. WebRM is packaged with a maximum number of Virtual Clients, Probing Clients and WebLOAD Console seats, as defined by the WebLOAD license.



### What is the Product of Your WebLOAD Testing?

WebLOAD continuously samples the activity while a Load Session is in progress, and saves a wide variety of measurement data. You can view all or part of the data in real time or after the Load Session is complete. Data can be displayed in tabular format or in graphical format. At the conclusion of a Load Session, data can automatically be exported to a spreadsheet program, HTML or as a tab-delimited file to a database application. Reports can also be created using WebLOAD Analytics.



### HTTP Client
Using the HTTP client testing mode, testers can simulate the user scenario at the protocol level. Each Virtual Client sends HTTP methods (and/or other protocol calls) to the server based on the recorded script. This is a low-level, "nuts-and-bolts" approach that focuses on specific internal implementation commands, such as HTTP transactions.

Scripts created for HTTP Client mode focus on HTTP transactions. HTTP Client scripts are created through the WebLOAD Recorder. The WebLOAD Recorder is an easy-to- use tool that facilitates the writing of test scripts for HTTP Client mode. The WebLOAD Recorder records your actions as you navigate through a Web application, automatically generating a script that reflects your actions in JavaScript, writing the GET and POST HTTP protocol commands that correspond to your browser activities. You can then use these scripts to test the performance of your Web application during WebLOAD test sessions.

Working in HTTP Client mode provides users with the most efficient, portable, powerful work mode. HTTP Client mode is *portable to many operating systems*, including all different flavors of *Windows*, *Linux*, *Solaris*, and so on. HTTP Client mode runs so *efficiently* that users can achieve large benchmarks by simulating extremely heavy test loads of *thousands* of clients. HTTP Client mode also provides the most *comprehensive, detailed statistical analysis and test reports*.

Working in HTTP Client mode does require a certain level of programming sophistication, since it can require hands-on programming of the JavaScript scripts with HTTP protocol code, as described in the *WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide*. HTTP Client mode scripts are designed to be run only on WebLOAD.

#### HTTP Client Feature Summary

## How are Tests Defined?

WebLOAD tests are configured by creating Load Templates, which define the events to occur in the test session. Using the WebLOAD Wizard, you can quickly and easily define basic Load Templates that include:

- The scripts (test scripts) to run
- The machines on which to run the test
- The number of Virtual Clients to run
- The test schedule

After creating a basic Load Template with the WebLOAD Wizard you can modify the template to include advanced features, such as connection speed, browser type, and pass/fail definitions, through the WebLOAD Console ribbon.



## Configuring WebLOAD

A Load Session includes the following components:

|**Component**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|Console|<p>The Console controls set up, manages a Load Session, and displays the Load Session results.</p><p>It is recommended that the Console reside on its own separate system and not be installed on systems running Load Generators or Probing Clients.</p>|
|<p>SUT</p><p>(System Under Test)</p>|The Web application to be tested. WebLOAD can test any Web application that can be accessed through a Web browser, on the Internet or intranet. The SUT requires no special software.|
|Load Machine|The host(s) that runs Load Generators. The Load Generators bombard the SUT with user-defined transactions for testing scalability and integrity of the SUT.|
|Probing Client Machine (optional)|The host(s) that run Probing Clients. A Probing Client runs at the same time as load testing. WebLOAD generates exact values for the Probing Client performance as opposed to averages for Load Generator performance.|
|WebRM|WebRM distributes and circulates WebLOAD testing resources (Virtual Clients, Probing Clients, and WebLOAD Consoles) amongst users on a "need to use" basis.|


The following diagram shows a simple WebLOAD test configuration. The Load Machine and the Probing Client Machine both access the SUT. The Console controls the test from a separate system. All three computers are networked.

![Simple Test Configuration Diagram](../images/console_users_guide_0029.jpeg)






### Required Software for each Load Session Component

|**Test Session Component**|**Required Software for Running Test Session Component**|
| :- | :- |
|Console|<p>- TestTalk</p><p>- Console</p>|
|SUT (System Under Test)|None|
|Load Generator|TestTalk|
|Probing Client (optional)|TestTalk|
|Shared disk (optional)|None|



### Example of a Test Configuration

The following diagram illustrates a typical WebLOAD test configuration.

![Typical Test Configuration Diagram](../images/console_users_guide_0030.jpeg)






This test session has three participating host computers. Two hosts act as *Load Machines*, and one host is a *Probing Client Machine*. In this configuration, the Console is run on a separate system. All systems are on a network with a shared disk that contains the script.

#### **The Console**

In the diagram above, the Console is a node on the network along with the host computers in the test session, and the shared disk. The Console communicates with the hosts that are testing the SUT through the TestTalk network agent. The Console controls the test setup, management and reporting.

> **Note:** Running a Load Machine on the same system running the Console software is not recommended.

#### **The Load Machine**

Web application tests can be run from either one Load Machine, or from several hosts simultaneously. The test load can be greater if the load is divided between multiple systems. For example, if one host can simulate 100 simultaneous Virtual Clients, a second host with the same capacity can simulate an equal number of Virtual Clients. When the two hosts run simultaneously, they can simulate double that number.

#### **Probing Client**

The Probing Client resides on the network with the other hosts in the test session. The Probing Client tests the performance of the SUT while it is being bombarded by the Load Machines. In this test session there is one Probing Client, however WebLOAD can support multiple Probing Clients in a test session. WebLOAD generates exact values for the Probing Client performance as opposed to averages for Load Machine performance.



### Sharing a script
You can increase the size of the test load by distributing the load generation tasks over multiple Load Machines. You may want all of these Load Machines to test the SUT using the same script. There are several ways to share a script over multiple systems.



#### Shared Disk

You can configure a shared disk that can be accessed by all the systems on the network, as shown in the previous diagram. The script can then reside on the shared disk, and can be used by all systems for testing. Thus there is only one copy of the script, and all the relevant hosts run it from the shared disk.



In this configuration, you must make sure that in the script configuration all hosts refer to the shared disk and are mapped to the same logical name. On one host the logical name of the shared disk may be "K" while on another host the logical name may be "L". Each host must configure the script using the correct logical name.



#### Copying the Test Program to Each Host

Copy the script to each host participating in the test. Verify that the most updated copy of the script resides on each system.



## Working with a Firewall

If your machine configuration is similar to the one illustrated below, no special WebLOAD configuration is necessary.

![Firewall Configuration](../images/console_users_guide_0032.jpeg)



In some cases you may want to use machine resources in the test session that reside on different sides of a firewall. In this case, you must change your initial settings to enable WebLOAD to accommodate this unique configuration.

The following diagrams illustrate situations where the Load Machine and the Console are on opposite sides of the firewall.

![Probing Client and Console Across Firewall](../images/console_users_guide_0033.jpeg)



![Load Machine and Console Across Firewall](../images/console_users_guide_0034.jpeg)



The following configuration is required to enable data transfer through the firewall. Generally, the rules that need to be added to the firewall are:

- Allow outgoing TCP from the Console all ports to Probing Client port 9000.
- Allow incoming TCP from Probing Client port 9000 to Console all ports (options=ackonly).


## Managing the Communication Between the Systems in your Load Session
The WebLOAD Console must be able to communicate with all of the hosts in your test session, those that run WebLOAD modules and those that run components of the SUT. All of the hosts must be on a common Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN). In addition to the physical network, all of the hosts running a WebLOAD module must be running TestTalk, the WebLOAD network agent, which is installed with WebLOAD.

### Working with TestTalk

TestTalk enables communication between the hosts in your Load Session. Each of the hosts participating in the test session must be running TestTalk in the background for the test to execute successfully.

TestTalk is automatically run when you start the Console. While TestTalk is running, the TestTalk icon is displayed in the Status bar.

> **Caution:** Do not close TestTalk in the middle of a test session. This can cause unexpected behavior. When shutting down the system, be sure to shut down the Console first and only then shut down TestTalk.



#### Viewing the Network Configuration

**To view the network configuration:**

- Right-click the TestTalk icon in the tray and select Net Configuration.



The following TestTalk message box appears.

![TestTalk Message Box](../images/console_users_guide_0035.png)



The information displayed in the TestTalk message box includes:

|**Item**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|Computer’s name|The name of your computer. You must know the name of each of the hosts to configure your test session. If you are not familiar with the name of your host, open TestTalk at that host and view the name in this message box.|
|Computer’s address|The IP address. You need this information to ping a host if you want to verify that it is connected to the network.|

#### Required Connections

WebLOAD can only run a test when the hosts participating in the test session are properly connected. Each participating host must have two types of connections. If either of these connections is not complete, you may experience problems running WebLOAD.

- Physical connection

  The hosts in the test session must all be physically connected to the network. They must be turned on and the connection must be live.

- Connected by network agent

  All of the hosts in the test session must be running TestTalk as a background process. Only the host controlling the tests must be running the Console.



#### Testing Your Connection

**To test your connection:**

1. Ping the host to test its physical connection to the network. This is described in [*Managing the Communication Between the Systems in your Load Session* ](#managing-the-communication-between-the-systems-in-your-load-session). If the host is not connected properly to the network, connect it and rerun WebLOAD.

1. If the ping is acknowledged, verify that TestTalk is running on the host. This is done by checking the actual host to verify that the TestTalk program is functioning. If TestTalk is not running, open TestTalk by selecting **Start** > **Programs** > **RadView** **WebLOAD** > **TestTalk** and retry the program.

    TestTalk runs in the background. Error messages are displayed on the program window. Check this window for any error messages that may explain the problem.

1. If there is still a problem with the host, you may be experiencing problems not related to TestTalk. Restart the system and rerun WebLOAD.



## Pinging a Host

You can test a host’s physical connection to the Console by pinging the remote host. The response that the Console receives from the ping indicates the status of the connection to the remote computer.

#### **To ping a host:**

- From the operating system, type **ping systemname**. Example:

  `c:> ping systemname`
  
  

#### Acknowledgments from a Ping

You can receive several types of acknowledgments from a ping:

- Ping systemname with 32 bytes of data.

  `reply from 192.114.35.1: bytes = 32 time = 1ms TTL = 255` 

  `reply from 192.114.35.1: bytes = 32 time = 1ms TTL = 255` 
  
  `reply from 192.114.35.1: bytes = 32 time = 1ms TTL = 255` 
  
  `reply from 192.114.35.1: bytes = 32 time = 10ms TTL = 255`
  
  This acknowledgment indicates that the host is connected properly. If you receive this response, and WebLOAD continues to return an error, test the TestTalk network agent.

- Bad IP address systemname.

  Indicates that the remote host is not connected properly. The host must be physically connected to the network, and configured properly.

- Request timed out.

  Indicates that the IP address is known to the Console, however the host is not currently working. The host must be turned on and tested again.



## Troubleshooting Communications

On occasion, you may have trouble with a WebLOAD host. Refer to the following table for possible solutions.

|**Problem**|**Solution**|
| :- | :- |
|<p>At the beginning of a test session, the host prompts:</p><p>`All hosts are stopped`.</p><p>This indicates that none of the hosts are accessible and the Domain Name Server (DNS) cannot recognize a host name.</p>|<p>Test your connection, as described in</p><p>[*Testing Your Connection* ](#testing-your-connection).</p>|
|<p>At the beginning of a test session, a host prompts:</p><p>`Load Session Setup –timed out, not completed.`</p><p>This indicates that at least one host is not accessible and the Domain Name Service (DNS) cannot recognize a host name.</p>|<p>Test your connection, as described in</p><p>[*Testing Your Connection* ](#testing-your-connection).</p>|
|Your system starts, but the test session times out during operation.|<p>Test your connection, as described in</p><p>[*Testing Your Connection* ](#testing-your-connection).</p><p>Check the names of the computers in the TestTalk Help menu, under Net Configuration. Verify that there is complete consistency between the names of the computers and the names used in WebLOAD.</p>|
|WebLOAD reports unexpected results from a test.|Access the System Under Test (SUT). If you have a good connection, the test results are accurate.|
|<p>The system issues the message:</p><p>`Error loading script…`</p>|The Console must specify the complete path of the script that is used by the remote host. For example, if the script is on a shared disk, the name of the disk in the path specified by the Console, must be the same name used by the remote host.|
