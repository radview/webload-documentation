# WebLOAD Console Performance Reports

The WebLOAD Dashboard and WebLOAD Transactions Dashboard display a summary of performance statistics generated during the test session. Integrated Reports enable you to configure a report that combines the following:

- Performance data from the Load Machines and Probing Clients
- Performance data on the SUT, gathered from Performance Monitors
- Existing performance data from a previously saved Load Session with data from the currently running Load Session

Combining several different measurements into a single report gives you a more complete picture of your Web application’s performance.

## Viewing Test Results on the WebLOAD Dashboard

The WebLOAD Dashboard displays real-time statistical information about the test session for the following categories:

|**Category**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |

1. Click **OK**.

    The new timer is included in the Integrated Report.



### Importing Report Parameters from a Saved Load Template
WebLOAD Console enables you to import a complete report configuration or to import a report configuration for a selected component in the Load Session.

#### Importing a Complete Report Configuration

**To import a complete report configuration:**

1. In the **Reports** dialog box, click **Import All**. The Open dialog box appears.
1. Select the Load Template to import.
1. Click **Open**.

    The Import dialog box displays a list of reports contained in the selected Load Template.

1. Select the report that contains the desired configuration.
1. Click **OK**.

    The report is configured to display the same measurements.

> **Note:** If the imported configuration contains a measurement not configured in the current report, WebLOAD Console ignores the measurement in the Load Template file and does not add it to the report.

This function imports the Integrated Report test configuration from the selected Load Template file. None of the other information in the Load Template file is imported.

1. Select the component that contains the desired configuration.

    The current component is configured to display the same measurements.

    > **Note:** If the imported component contains a measurement that is not configured in the current report, WebLOAD Console ignores the measurement in the Load Template file. It does not add it to the report.

    This function imports the Integrated Report test configuration from the selected Load Template file. None of the other information in the Load Template file is imported.



## Load Generator Performance Statistics

You can configure a report that displays a summary of Load Generator performance statistics generated during the test session. This is useful for analyzing your Load Generator capacity and gauging the load on the Load Generator itself. The Load Generator performance statistics include:

- Free memory – Free memory of the machine hosting the Load Generator
- Global CPU usage – The total CPU usage of the machine hosting the Load Generator
- Load Generator CPU usage - CPU usage of the Load Generator process
- Server Latency

In addition, if the [*Show Performance Warnings* ](set_script_options.md#enabling-show-performance-warnings)option is selected in the **Diagnostics** tab of the **Default/Current Session Options** or **Script Options**, WebLOAD automatically sends warning messages when Load Generators are getting overloaded, so you know how to better utilize the Load Generators in your current and future tests.



**To add Load Generator statistics to an integrated report:**

1. Open a report, as follows:
    1. Click **Integrated Report Manager** in the **Session** tab of the ribbon. The Integrated Reports dialog box appears.
    1. Click **New** to open a new report, or select an existing report and click **Edit**. The Report dialog box appears.
1. Alternatively, click Update in the Integrated Report toolbar, to update the display in the report while a test is in progress.

    ![New Report Dialog Box](../images/console_users_guide_2047.png)

1. Select items under **\_Performance@LoadGenerator** to indicate the Load Generator measurements you want displayed in the Integrated Report.


## Regression Testing

Regression testing enables you to compare Load Sessions while tests are running, or after the test session is completed. WebLOAD regression testing reports enable you to visualize, verify, and compare results over time to confirm that results only vary in ways that you expect them to.

Regression testing enables you to configure a report that compares:



- Existing performance data from a previously saved or "expected" Load Session with data from the currently running test session.
- Existing performance data from two previously saved Load Sessions.

Combining performance results from several different Load Sessions into a single report enables you to view, verify and compare results over time and ensure that results only vary in ways that you expect them to.



### Configuring an Integrated Report to Include Data from Previously Saved Load Sessions

**To configure an Integrated Report to include data from previously saved Load Sessions:**

1. Click **Integrated Report Manager** in the **Session** tab of the ribbon. The Integrated Report dialog box appears.
1. Click **New**.

    The Reports dialog box appears.

1. In the Reports dialog box, click **Add Session**. The Open dialog box appears.
1. Select the Load Session ( \*.ls) file to add and click **Open**. The Load Session is added to the Report dialog box.
1. Configure the Integrated Report to include the measurements you want to view, see [*Configuring an Integrated Report* ](#configuring-an-integrated-report). If a measurement is already selected in the current Load Session it is automatically selected in the Load Session selected to be included in the report.
1. Click **OK**.

    The report displays in the Console Results window.



### Removing a Previously Saved Load Session from the Integrated Report Configuration

**To remove a previously saved Load Session from the Integrated Report configuration:**

1. Select the Load Session you want to remove from the Integrated Report configuration in the Reports dialog box.
1. Click **Remove Session**.

    The Load Session is removed from the Report dialog box, and any measurements displayed for that Load Session in the Console Results window are removed.


## Viewing Integrated Reports

In the Integrated Report, WebLOAD Console displays the results of your test in a line graph. Separate lines track each measurement selected in the report configuration.

![Integrated Report](../images/console_users_guide_2050.png)



The report above shows an Integrated Report that includes four measurements. Each is tracked on a different line graph. The line graphs are color-coded to match the measurements on the bottom half of the report.

**Features of this graph:**

- The upper part of the report displays a line graph for each measurement tracked in the report. The X-Axis represents the elapsed time (in seconds) for this test session. The Y-Axis represents the actual value for each measurement, displayed as a percentage relative to the defined maximum Scale Value.
- Hover over a colored line graph to view the exact value for the selected point.
- The scroll bar at the center of the screen provides you with a quick and easy way to access points in the test session currently not in focus.

- The lower part of the report displays a list of the measurements being tracked for each host and each session, the current value of the measurement and, in the last column on the right, the maximum Scale Value set for each measurement.
- The Time Range field in the top right-hand corner displays the time scale for the

  X-Axis. In this graph, the X-Axis displays a window of 200 seconds out of the total time span of the Load Session. Using the arrows on the Time Range field, you can change the number of seconds to achieve the report display you desire.

- If you are tracking more than one measurement, the top graph shows multiple graph lines. To bring up a history focusing on a specific measurement, double-click a single measurement line in the Integrated Report.

![Specific Measurement History](../images/console_users_guide_2051.png)





### Changing the Scale of a Report for a Selected Measurement

**To change the scale of a report for a selected measurement:**

1. Right-click a specific measurement from the lower part of the report and select

    **Change Scale** from the pop-up menu,

    -Or-

    Double-click a specific measurement from the lower part of the report. The Change Scale dialog box appears.

    ![Change Scale Dialog Box](../images/console_users_guide_2052.jpeg)



1. Select one of the following:
    - **Auto Adjusted scale** – This uses an automatic scaling algorithm that determines the best way for the measurements to be displayed in the chart view. The scale adjusts itself according to changes in real time and the value adjusts itself according to the scale value. The Y scale of an integrated report for a number of measurements is 0-100. The points of each chart series (specific measurements) are calculated according to the automatic scaling algorithm: Real value \* 100 / scale value.
    - **User Adjusted scale** – This enables you to manually set the scale value.

1. Enter the new scale value.

1. Click **OK**.

    The scale of the report for that measurement changes in real time. The scale value for a measurement can also be changed after the test has run.



### Viewing the True Value vs. Relative Value of a Measurement

Each measurement displayed in the Integrated Reports has its own expression or value of measurement. For example, Timer results are measured in seconds. CPU is measured in terms of percentage of usage. Throughput is measured in kilobytes per second. All measurements appear as a percentage relative to the defined scale.

To change the scale value of a measurement, see [*Changing the Scale of a Report for a Selected Measurement](#changing-the-scale-of-a-report-for-a-selected-measurement). When you change the maximum value, WebLOAD Console displays the relative value of that measurement rather than the true value of a measurement.

**To view a measurement’s value:**

- Select the Data Editor toolbar button to display the relative value of the measurements in the chart.
- Select the Point Label toolbar button to display the real value of the measurements in the chart.

> **Note:** You can display the real value for a single line in the chart by right-clicking the desired line and selecting **Point Label** from the pop-up menu.



### Integrated Report Toolbar

At the top of the Integrated Report, find the Integrated Report toolbar. This toolbar offers a variety of options for customizing the Integrated Report display, tailoring the colors, perspective, and dimension as needed.

The following illustration shows the Integrated Report toolbar and the function of each toolbar button.
