# Glossary

|**Glossary Term**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|**Response Time**|<p>The time it takes the SUT to send the object of an HTTP request back to a Virtual Client, in seconds. In other words, the time from the end of the HTTP request until the Virtual Client has received the complete item it requested.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the SUT to respond to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|**Responses**|<p>The number of times the SUT responded to an HTTP request during the last reporting interval.</p><p>This number should match the number of successful hits.</p>|
|**Round Time**|<p>The time it takes one Virtual Client to finish one complete iteration of a script, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to finish one complete iteration of the script during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|**Rounds**|The total number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to run the script during the last reporting interval.|
|**Rounds Per Second**|<p>The number of times the Virtual Clients attempted to run the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of attempts (both successful and unsuccessful) per second during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|**Send Time**|<p>The time it takes the Virtual Client to write an HTTP request to the SUT, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the average time it took the Virtual Clients to write a request to the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|**Server Performance Measurements**|<p>If you selected Performance Monitor statistics for the report, WebLOAD creates a row for them and reports their values in the Statistics Report.</p><p>For definitions of the statistics, see the Server Monitor Definition dialog box.</p><p>Be selective when choosing server performance measurements , otherwise the system resources required to manage the data might affect the Console.</p>|
|**Session Tree**|A graphic representation of a Load Template and status. It illustrates the different components of a test session, including Load Machines and Probing Clients, the scripts that they execute, and their status.|
|**Single Client**|See Probing Client|
|**Standard Deviation**|The average amount the measurement varies from the average since the beginning of the test.|
|**Successful Connections**|<p>The total number of times the Virtual Clients were able to successfully connect to the SUT during the last reporting interval.</p><p>This number is always less than or equal to the number of successful hits because several hits might use the same HTTP connection if the Persistent Connection option is enabled.</p>|
|**Successful Hits**|The total number of times the Virtual Clients made an HTTP request and received the correct HTTP response from the SUT during the last reporting interval. Each request for each gif, jpeg, html file, etc., is a single hit.|
|**Successful Hits Per Second**|<p>The number of times the Virtual Clients obtained the correct HTTP response to their HTTP requests divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful HTTP requests per second during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|**Successful Pages Per Second**|The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful requests per second during the last reporting interval.|
|**Successful Rounds**|The total number of times the Virtual Clients completed one iteration of the script during the last reporting interval.|
|**Successful Rounds Per Second**|<p>The number of times the Virtual Clients completed an entire iteration of the script, divided by the elapsed time, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted in the Current Value column is the number (sum) of successful iterations of the script per second during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|<a name="_bookmark530"></a>**SUT**|The system running the Web application currently under test. The SUT (System Under Test) is accessed by clients through its URL address. The SUT can reside on any machine or on multiple machines, anywhere on the global Internet or your local intranet.|
|**Template**|See Load Template|
|<a name="_bookmark531"></a>**Templates Gallery**|The Templates Gallery is a single entity that contains predefined templates, user-defined templates, and portfolios.|
|**Test Program**|See Test Script|
|<a name="_bookmark532"></a>**Test Script**|The script. This defines the test scenario used in your Load Session. Scripts are written in JavaScript.|
|**Test Template**|See Load Template|
|**TestTalk**|The network agent. This program enables communication between the Console and the host computers participating in the test.|
|**Throttle Control**|A WebLOAD component that enables you to dynamically change the Load Size while a test session is in progress.|
|**Throughput (Bytes Per Second)**|The average number of bytes per second transmitted from the SUT to the Virtual Clients running the script during the last reporting interval. In other words, this is the amount of the Response Data Size, divided by the number of seconds in the reporting interval.|
|**Time to First Byte**|The time that elapsed since a request was sent until the Virtual Client received the first byte of data.|
|**User-defined Automatic Data Collection**|<p>If you have Automatic Data Collection enabled, WebLOAD creates three counters for each GET and POST statement in the script:</p><p>- The total number of times the Get and Post statements occurred</p><p>- The number of times the statements succeeded</p><p>- The number of times the statements failed during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|**User-defined counters**|<p>Your own counters that you can add to scripts using the SendCounter() and the SendMeasurement() functions (see the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*). If there is a user-defined counter in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports the counter’s values in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The row heading is the name (argument) of the counter. That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the SendCounter() or SendMeasurement() function call.</p><p>The value reported is the number of times the counter was incremented during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|**User-defined timer**|<p>Timers that you can add to scripts to keep track of the amount of time it takes to complete specific actions (see the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*). If there are any timers in the scripts that you are running, WebLOAD reports their values in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The row heading is the name (argument) of the timer. That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the SetTimer() function call. The timer represents the time it takes to complete all the actions between the SetTimer() call and its corresponding SendTimer() call, in seconds.</p><p>The value posted is the average time it took a Virtual Client to complete the actions between the pair of timer calls, in seconds, during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|**User-defined Transaction counters**|<p>Transaction functions that you can add to scripts for functional tests (see the *WebLOAD Scripting Guide*). If there is a user-defined transaction function in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports three counters for it in the Statistics Report:</p><p>- The total number of times the transaction occurred</p><p>- The number of times a transaction succeeded</p><p>- The number of times a transaction failed during the last reporting interval.</p><p>The row heading is the name (argument) of the transaction. That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call.</p>|
|**User-defined Transactions timers**|<p>A timer for user-defined transaction functions. If there is a user-defined transaction function in the script that you are running, WebLOAD reports a timer for it in the Statistics Report.</p><p>The row heading is the name (argument) of the user- defined transaction. That is, the row heading is the string in parenthesis in the BeginTransaction() function call.</p><p>The timer represents the average time it took to complete all the actions between the BeginTransaction() call and its corresponding EndTransaction() call, in seconds, during the last reporting interval.</p>|
|**Virtual Client**|<p>Artificial entities run by Load Generators. Each such entity is a perfect simulation of a real client accessing the System Under Test (SUT) through a Web browser.</p><p>Virtual Clients generate HTTP calls that access the SUT. The Load Generators that run Virtual Clients can reside anywhere on the Internet or on your local intranet.</p><p>Scripts are executed by all the Virtual Clients in parallel, achieving simultaneous access to the SUT. The size of the load on your SUT is determined by the number of Virtual Clients being generated. You may define as many Virtual Clients as needed, up to the maximum supported by your WebLOAD "package."</p>|
|**WebLOAD Analytics**|WebLOAD Analytics enables you to analyze data, and create custom, informative reports after running a WebLOAD test session.|
|**WebLOAD Console**|See Console|
|**WebLOAD Recorder**|An easy-to-use tool for recording, creating, and authoring protocol scripts for the WebLOAD environment.|
|**WebLOAD Load Template**|See Load Template|
|**WebLOAD Session**|See Load Session|
|**WebLOAD Wizard**|A WebLOAD Wizard that steps you through the configuration process. Each screen of the WebLOAD Wizard contains text explaining the configuration process. The WebLOAD Wizard enables you to create a basic Load Template. After using the demo, you can use the Console menus to add functionality not available through the WebLOAD Wizard.|
