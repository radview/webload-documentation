# Working with HTTP Protocol

Website load testing usually means testing how typical user activities are handled by the system under test not in a single-user scenario but rather under heavy usage load. Using load testing, we can test the system’s performance, scalability and reliability, all in real-life simulated usage scenarios and patterns. A system’s performance is all about how fast it functions; its reliability is about how often it’s available (where a system might be unavailable due to a lack of a certain resource or because of a bug); and a

system’s scalability is about how these two factors (performance and reliability) change as the usage of the system increases.

WebLOAD was designed as a protocol-level load testing tool, enabling the QA

professional to "bombard" the system under test with protocol-level commands and transactions, simulating real usage of a large amount of users. The main and most important protocol for load testing Internet applications is the HTTP protocol.

WebLOAD supports the common HTTP methods and headers, as defined in the HTTP RFCs, most notably RFC 2616 (1999), that was defined by the W3C and the IETF.The WebLOAD DOM extension set includes objects, methods, properties, and functions that support designing tests at the HTTP protocol level. Using the DOM, functional and verification tests can be done, to check the system’s reliability under load.

This chapter documents the features that apply to QA professionals creating scripts based on the HTTP Protocol, where HTTP transactions and the responses they trigger are the focus of the test session. This chapter includes a few sample scripts that you can study to help learn the HTTP Protocol testing technique. The examples are fictitious, but you can copy the scripts and edit them for use in real WebLOAD tests. More sample scripts may be found on the WebLOAD Script Libraries, at [http://www.webload.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=160.](http://www.webload.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=160)



## Understanding the WebLOAD DOM Structure

For optimum website testing, WebLOAD extended the standard browser DOM with many features and functions that are critical to site testing and evaluation. The following figure, an extended version of the basic DOM hierarchy tree, highlights many of the added elements of the WebLOAD DOM hierarchy. The remainder of this chapter provides more detailed information about some of the special elements and features that WebLOAD added to the basic DOM model that are used when working in HTTP Protocol mode.

![WebLOAD DOM Hierarchy](../images/dom_hierarchy.png)

The preceding illustration highlights in bold the WebLOAD extensions used by WebLOAD when working with the Document Object Model.

> **Note:** WebLOAD-specific objects are identified by the wl prefix.

The following table lists some of the extensions that WebLOAD has added to the standard DOM objects, properties, and methods.

|**WebLOAD extensions**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|**Objects**||
|wlCookie|Sets and deletes cookies.|
|wlException|WebLOAD error management object.|
|wlGeneratorGlobal and wlSystemGlobal objects|Handles global values shared between script threads or Load Generators.|

|wlGetAllLinks|Retrieves a collection of all links (<A> elements) in an HTML page and its nested frames.|

## Using Multiple IP Addresses

WebLOAD enables the creation of a single test script that includes multiple IP addresses, simulating the behavior of actual users.

> **Note:** Before you enable support of multiple IP addresses, you must first generate additional IP addresses on your machine to use when testing.

Enable the use of all available IP addresses through the property `wlGlobals.MultiIPSupport`. The values of `MultiIPSupport` are:

- false – Use only one IP address. (default)
- true – Use all available IP addresses.

Indicate whether WebLOAD should use the same IP or a different IP for every round, by setting the value of the `wlGlobals.MultiIPSupportType` property which supports the following values:

- PerClient – WebLOAD preserves the current behavior, meaning that there are different IPs per client but the same IP is used for all rounds. This is the default setting.
- PerRound – WebLOAD supports the use of a different IP from the pool per client, per round, until the pool is exhausted, after which it returns to the beginning.

The exact number of IPs that WebLOAD supports depends on the operating system being used:

- With Unix, WebLOAD uses the `gethostbyname()` function to access the IP address. There is no limit to the number of IP addresses that WebLOAD supports.
- With Windows, WebLOAD loads an SNMP agent dll file, through which WebLOAD accesses the IP information. The SNMP agent exists on all Windows versions since Win95 and NT, even if an SNMP agent is not installed. This method queries all of the IPs, one at a time, and places the result in a list maintained in the WebLOAD’s engine code. WebLOAD continues to go over the entire IP list, until it reaches the engine code’s limit of 100,000 IPs.

  If for some reason the SNMP does not work, WebLOAD uses another method whose limitation is 35 IPs.

### **Generating IP Addresses in the script**
After enabling the use of all available IP addresses, you can generate additional IP addresses on your machine by setting the TCP/IP properties through the Windows UI. For further instructions consult your system administrator. Alternatively, you can use the FillIP.bat file provided with WebLOAD, as described below.



**To generate IP addresses in the script:**

1. Locate the `FillIP.bat` file in `<WebLOAD directory>\bin`.

1. Run the batch file by entering the file name in the command line or double-clicking the file.

    The command line window appears.
    ![Command Line Window](../images/command_line_window.png)

1. Enter the `netsh` command to generate the list of IP addresses.

    `FillIP IP\_prefix subnet\_mask gateway from to`


The `netsh` command parameters are described in the following table:

|**Parameter**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|IP\_prefix|<p>The prefix used for all of the generated IP addresses. For example, if IP\_prefix</p><p>is 192.168 then the generated IP address structure is 192.168.xxx.xxx.</p>|
|subnet\_mask|The subnet\_mask is matched with the IP address to determine the fourth section of the generated IP address, along with the gateway value. For example 255.255.0.0.|
|gateway|The gateway used for all of the generated IP addresses to determine the fourth section of the generated IP address, along with the subnet\_mask value. For example, 192.168.0.1.|
|from to|Used to generate the third section in the IP address. For example, if from to is 1 24, then the generated IP addresses are all from xxx.xxx.1.xxx to xxx.xxx.24.xxx.|


Upon successful completion, the Command Line window returns OK. If an error is encountered (for example, an illegal IP address), the Command Line window returns details about the error.

For example, to generate approximately 6000 IP addresses, use the following command in the script:

`FillIP 192.168 255.255.0.0 192.168.0.1 1 24`

The following IP addresses are generated:

|192\.168.1.1|192\.168.2.1|…|192\.168.24.1|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|192\.168.1.2|192\.168.2.2|…|192\.168.24.2|
|<p>…</p><p>192\.168.1.255</p>|<p></p><p>192\.168.2.255</p>|<p></p><p>…</p>|<p></p><p>192\.168.24.255</p>|



## Parsing Web Pages

Web testing sessions work with Web pages, by accessing a specified page and verifying that all operations are completed correctly. As part of the Web page access, downloaded Web pages are parsed and the data from each page stored in a logical structure. This section gives a brief overview of the parsing approach to a Web page.



### **Parsing and Navigating Nested Frames on a Dynamic HTML Page**
The following script downloads a dynamic HTML page belonging to a retailer that advertises on the Internet. The second frame on the page offers bargain prices on three different items each hour. The script performs the following operations, some of which are marked in bold in the script code:

- Downloads the page including the nested frames.
- Retrieves the second frame.
- Searches the HTML source code of the second frame to find the <TITLE> element.
- Confirms that the title is "Offer of the Hour". (If it is not, the script displays an error message and stops the current round of the thread where the error occurred. The thread continues with the next round.)
- Randomly selects one of the first three links in the second frame.
- Follows the link.

> **Note:** This script includes DOM objects that are not explained in this section. For more information about a specific object or usage, (such as `wlGlobals`, `wlRand`, or `wlHttp`), see that object’s section in the *WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide*



```javascript
function InitAgenda()
{
//Enable parsing of all links 
    wlGlobals.ParseLinks = true
    //Enable downloading nested frames
    wlGlobals.GetFrames =	true
}
function InitClient()
{
//Initialize the random number generator with a
//different seed for each thread (ensures that each
//thread follows a different sequence of links)       
    wlRand.Seed(ClientNum)
}
//Main script Body
//Store the most recent download in document .wlSource 
wlHttp.SaveSource = true
//Download the dynamic HTML page
wlHttp.Get("http://www.webloadmpstore.com/general_sample/frames/frames.htm")
//Retrieve the second frame 
MyFrame = document.frames[1] 
InfoMessage(MyFrame)
InfoMessage(MyFrame.document.wlSource)

//Confirm that the <TITLE> element of the frame is
//"Offer of the Hour". If it is not, display an error
//message and abort the current round.
//Remember to escape the slash in </TITLE>

// Using extractValue to catch the title
myTitle = extractValue( "<title>", "<\/title>", MyFrame.document.wlSource)

// will print the content of the title 
InfoMessage (myTitle )

if (myTitle	!= "offer of the hour")
{
    ErrorMessage("Thread " + ClientNum.toString() + ", Round " + RoundNum.toString() + ": Title is not ‘Offer of the Hour’ but is " + myTitle )
}
//Retrieve the URL of a randomly selected link
SelectedItem = wlRand.Select(0, 1, 2)
LinkUrl = MyFrame.document.links[SelectedItem].href InfoMessage(LinkUrl )
//Follow the link 
wlHttp.Get(LinkUrl)
```


### Using wlHtml to Follow a Dynamic Link
The third link on a company’s home page is an advertisement that links to one of several products. On successive accesses, the advertisement switches dynamically among the products.

The following WebLOAD script tests the time that a user would need to follow the link.

The script:

- Links to the home page and parses the HTML code.
- Retrieves the URL of the third link.
- Measures the time it takes WebLOAD to:
    - Download the main page and, depending on the parameters, do any of the following:
          - Download frames, images, tables, or whatever else has been specified.
          - Download nested subframes, images, etc.
          - Parse the document.

In this script, WebLOAD displays two time statistics:

- The Round Time.
- The Link Time.

```javascript
function InitAgenda()
   {
    //Set the default URL to the dynamic HTML home page
    wlGlobals.Url = "http://www.ABCDEF.com"
    //Parse links. Forms are not needed. 
    wlGlobals.ParseLinks = true 
    wlGlobals.ParseForms = false
    }
//Main script
//Connect to the home page 
wlHttp.Get()
// Retrieve the third link on the home page using the manual
// GetLinkByIndex() method.
// See IdentifyObject() for the dynamic ASM alternative 
Link3 = wlHtml.GetLinkByIndex(3)
//Measure the time to connect to the link 
SetTimer("Link Time") 
wlHttp.Get(Link3.href)
SendTimer("Link Time")
```


## Data Submission Properties

You may submit many types of data to an HTTP server in a Get, Post, or Head command. For example, you can submit a search string, the results of form fields, or a file. You may assign values to variable data stored in these collections using the `wlSet` method.

The `wlHttp` object provides the following collections to store the data that you want to submit:

- `FormData`
- `Data`
- `DataFile`
- `Header`

At the time you first create your test script, you should decide which collection is most appropriate for your test session activities.

- `FormData` is the standard collection of field values, common to all HTML forms.
- `Header` is the collection of header field values only.
- `Data` and DataFile are both collections that hold sets of data.
    - `Data` collections are stored within the script itself, and are useful when you prefer to see the data directly.
    - `DataFile` collections store the data in local text files, writing only the name of the data file within the script itself, and are useful when you are working with large amounts of data, which would be too cumbersome to store within the script code itself.

Your script can work with both `Data` and `DataFile `collections. Do not use both properties on the same object (a single HTTP request can use either `Data` or `DataFile` collections, but not both).

### **FormData**
`FormData` is a collection containing form field values. WebLOAD submits the field values to the HTTP server when you call one of the following methods of the `wlHttp` object:

- `Get()`
- `Post()`
- `Head()`

The collection indices are the field names (HTML name attributes). Before you call `wlHttp.Post()`, set the value of each element to the data that you want to submit in the HTML field. The fields can be any HTML controls, such as:

- buttons
- text areas
- hidden controls

Generally, when an HTTP client (Microsoft Internet Explorer/Firefox or WebLOAD) sends a URL-encoded request to the server, the data is HTTP encoded. Different clients
– browsers or JavaScript functions such as Ajax – perform encoding with slight differences. Encoding form data replaces special characters such as blanks, ">" signs, and so on, with "%xx" (an ASCII hexa number). For example, a space is encoded as "%20" or as a "+".

The `Get()` method converts a URL address to contain only allowed URL characters. The `Post()` method converts the content of forms to contain only allowed URL characters. Forms contain one of the following content types:

- `FormData ["key"]` – a value
- `Data []` – raw information
- `DataFile []` – both a value and raw information

Turn off the encoding when the script sends large requests that have no data that needs to be encoded. This improves performance as it bypasses the scanning and reformatting of the request buffer. You can enable or disable encoding, by accessing the HTTP Parameters tab in the Current or Default Project Options dialog box, in WebLOAD Recorder. Check or uncheck Encode Form Data to enable or disable encoding.

#### Getting FormData Using Get

You can get form data using a `Get()` call. For example:

`wlHttp.FormData["FirstName"] = "Bill"`

`wlHttp.FormData["LastName"] = "Smith"` 

`wlHttp.FormData["EmailAddress"] = "bsmith@ABCDEF.com"` 

`[wlHttp.Get("http://www.ABCDEF.com/submit.cgi")](http://www.ABCDEF.com/submit.cgi)`



WebLOAD appends the form data to the URL as a query statement, using the

following syntax:

`http://www.ABCDEF.com/submit.cgi`
    `?FirstName=Bill&LastName=Smith`
    `&EmailAddress=bsmith@ABCDEF.com`



#### Submitting FormData Using Post()

Suppose you are testing an HTML form that requires name and email address data. You need to submit the form to the submit.cgi program, which processes the data.

You can code this in the following way:

`wlHttp.FormData["FirstName"] = "Bill"` 

`wlHttp.FormData["LastName"] = "Smith"`

`wlHttp.FormData["EmailAddress"] = "bsmith@ABCDEF.com"` 
`wlHttp.Post("http://www.ABCDEF.com/submit.cgi")`

The `Post()` call connects to `submit.cgi` and sends the `FormData` fields. In the above example, WebLOAD would post the following fields:

`FirstName=Bill` 

`LastName=Smith`

`EmailAddress=bsmith@ABCDEF.com`



#### Submitting FormData with Missing Fields

You can use the string "`$WL$EMPTY$STRING$`" to represent a missing name or value (an empty string) in a FormData field. You can use the string "`$WL$VOID$STRING$`" to represent a token that is posted alone, without even an equal sign.

The following lines illustrate the syntax:

`wlHttp.FormData["FirstName"] ="$WL$EMPTY$STRING$"` 

`wlHttp.FormData["$WL$EMPTY$STRING$"] = "Smith"` 

`wlHttp.FormData["EmailAddress"] = "$WL$VOID$STRING$"` 

`wlHttp.Post("http://www.ABCDEF.com/submit.cgi")`

In this example, the `Post()` call sends the following data:

`FirstName=`

`=Smith`

`EmailAddress`

A `Get()` call using the same form data would send:

`http://www.ABCDEF.com/submit.cgi?FirstName=&=Smith&EmailAddress`


> **Note:** JavaScript supports two equivalent notations for named collection elements:
> `FormData.FirstName` 
> `FormData["FirstName"]`
>The latter notation also supports spaces in the name, for example, FormData["First Name"].



#### Using FormData with Data Files

You can coordinate the `FormData` property with input data files. In this case, one of the `FormData` fields stores identifying information about the data file, including the name of the file and the type of data in the file (text, binary, bmp, etc.).

The following lines illustrate the syntax:

`wlHttp.FormData["InputFile.wlFile-Name"] = "myFavoritePicture"` 

`wlHttp.FormData["InputFile.wlContent-Type] = "bmp"`



The following script fragment illustrates the `FormData` properties documented in this section. The input file lines are marked in bold.

```



### Data
`Data` is a string to be submitted in an HTTP Post command. The Data property has two subfields:

- `Data.Type`—the MIME type for the submission
- `Data.Value`—the string to submit 
    You can use Data in two ways:
- As an alternative to `FormData` if you know the syntax of the form submission.
- To submit a string that is not a standard HTML form and cannot be represented by `FormData`.

Thus the following three code samples are equivalent:

```
//Sample 1 
wlHttp.Data.Type =
    "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" 
wlHttp.Data.Value =
    "SearchFor=icebergs&SearchType=ExactTerm"
wlHttp.Post("http://www.ABCDEF.com/query.exe")
//Sample 2
wlHttp.FormData.SearchFor = "icebergs" 
wlHttp.FormData.SearchType = "ExactTerm" 
wlHttp.Post("http://www.ABCDEF.com/query.exe")
//Sample 3 
wlHttp.Post
("http://www.ABCDEF.com/query.exe" + "?SearchFor=icebergs&SearchType=ExactTerm")

```

> **Note:** `Data` and `DataFile` are both collections that hold sets of data.
`Data` collections are stored within the script itself, and are useful when you prefer to see the data directly.
`DataFile` collections store the data in local text files, and are useful when you are working with large amounts of data, which would be too cumbersome to store within the script code itself. When working with `DataFile` collections, only the name of the text file is stored in the script itself.

Your script can work with both Data and DataFile collections. Do not use both properties for the same lHTTP object (a single HTTP request can use either Data or DataFile properties, but not both). When you record your script with the WebLOAD Recorder, use the Post Data tab in the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box to define the default behavior for submitting content types. The default behaviors are `Data` and `DataFile`, although you can edit these definitions and add additional predefined behaviors for other content types as well.



### DataFile
`DataFile` is a file to be submitted in an HTTP Post command. WebLOAD sends the file using a MIME protocol.

`DataFile` has two subfields:

- `DataFile.Type`—the MIME type

- `DataFile.Filename`—the name of the file, for example:

    `"c:\\MyWebloadData\\BigFile.doc"`

WebLOAD sends the contents of the file stored in <filename> in the Post command.

### **Header**
A collection of HTTP header fields that you want to send in a `Get()`, `Post()`, or `Head()` call.

By default, WebLOAD sends the following header in any HTTP command:

`Accept: */*`
`User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Host: <host>`
`Connection:Keep-Alive`
Here, `<host>` is the host name to which you are connecting, for example:

`www.ABCDEF.com:81.`
By default, the Referer header is also recorded and sent, where it is being used by the Web server.

You may reset these properties, for example, as follows:

`wlHttp.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.03 [en] (WinNT; I)"`

> **Note:** The user-agent header is defined in WebLOAD Recorder. Access **Tools**  **Default or Current Project Options**, select the Browser Parameters tab, and edit the user-agent field.

Alternatively, you can use the Header property to override one of the default header fields. For example, you can redefine the following header field:

`wlHttp.Header["user-agent"] = "Mozilla/4.03 [en] (WinNT; I)"`


Additional header fields are recorded and sent according to the checked Record Headers options in the Script Content tab of the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box (in WebLOAD Recorder):

`Accept-Language: en-us`
`UA-CPU: x86`
`Pragma: no-cache`

> **Note:** The headers `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Matched` will be commented out to overcome the situation where recorded links were fetched from the browser’s cache during the recording. The request header `Accept-Encode: gzip` will also be commented out, to ensure correct behavior.

When the Record Custom Headers option is enabled, WebLOAD records any headers that are not explicitly defined in the RFC, such as the SOAP Action header. This option is not selected by default.


> **Note:** Any information set using the `wlHttp.Header` property *takes priority* over any defaults set using the global, local, or other wlHttp properties. If there is any discrepancy between the document header information and the HTTP values, WebLOAD will work with the information found in the `wlHttp.Header` property while also issuing a warning to the user.

WebLOAD offers a simple way to reset configuration properties using the Options tab of the Session Control menu. Resetting configuration properties as you run and rerun various testing scenarios allows you to fine tune your tests to match your exact needs at that moment. However, that this real-time configuration setting will be overruled by any configuration properties that are explicitly set by `wlHttp.Header` within your test scripts. For greatest reliability and flexibility, WebLOAD recommends that you set header properties using the more general `wlGlobals`, `wlLocals`, and `wlHttp` object properties, fine-tuning your test sessions using the WebLOAD Session menu.See [*Rules of Scope for Local and Global Variables* ](./programming_your_javascript.md#rules-of-scope-for-local-and-global-variables), for more information on precedence and priority in script variables. Remember that you cannot override the host header or set a cookie header using the `Header` property. 

### Erase
Clear the WebLOAD properties of a `wlHttp` object after each `Get(), Post(),` or `Head()` call.

`WlHttp.Erase` is a read/write property. The default value is `true`. This section will describe the implications of each setting.

#### Erase=true (default)

When `Erase` is set to `true`, WebLOAD automatically erases all `wlHttp` property values after each HTTP access. You must reassign any properties you need before the next HTTP access. For this reason, assign the properties of `wlHttp` only in the *main script*, not in `InitClient()`, so they will be reassigned in every round.

Thus if `Erase` is set to `true` the following script is incorrect. In this script, the `wlHttp` properties are assigned values in `InitClient()`. The script would connect to the Url and submit the FormData only in the first round. After the first `Post()` call, the `Url` and FormData property values are erased, so WebLOAD cannot use them in subsequent rounds.

The following script displays the incorrect method of assigning the `wlHttp` properties:

```javascript
function InitClient() {	//Wrong! 
wlHttp.Url =
    "http://www.ABCDEF.com/products.exe"
wlHttp.FormData["Name"] = "John Smith" 
wlHttp.FormData["Product Interest"] = "Modems"
}
//Main script 
wlHttp.Post()
```
To solve the problem, assign the wlHttp property values in the main script, so that the assignments are executed before each `Get()`, `Post()`, or `Head()` call:

```javascript
//Main script	//OK 
wlHttp.Url =
   "http://www.ABCDEF.com/products.exe" 
wlHttp.FormData["Name"] = "John Smith" 
wlHttp.FormData["Product Interest"] = "Modems" 
wlHttp.Post()
```

Alternatively, you could assign values to `wlLocals` properties, which are not erased:

```javascript
function InitClient() {	//OK 
wlLocals.Url =
    "http://www.ABCDEF.com/products.exe"
wlLocals.FormData["Name"] = "John Smith" 
wlLocals.FormData["Product Interest"] =
    "Modems"
}
//Main script 
wlHttp.Post()
```


#### Erase=false

You may set `Erase` to `false` to prevent erasure. For example, if for some reason you absolutely had to assign values to the wlHttp properties in the `InitClient()` function of the script, change the value of the `Erase` property to `false`. If Erase is `false`, the properties retain their values through subsequent rounds.

Thus another way to correct the preceding example is to write:

```javascript
function InitClient() {	//OK 
wlHttp.Erase = false
wlHttp.Url = "http://www.ABCDEF.com/products.exe" 
wlHttp.FormData["Name"] = "John Smith" 
wlHttp.FormData["Product Interest"] = "Modems"
}
//Main script 
wlHttp.Post()
```

User-defined properties are not linked to the `wlHttp.Erase` property and will not be erased automatically by WebLOAD. The only way to reset or erase user-defined properties is for the user to set the new values explicitly.

### Posting form Data Using Elements

**Note:** This script includes DOM objects that are not explained in this section. For more information about a specific object or usage, (such as `wlGlobals` or `wlHttp`), see that object’s section in the *WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide*.

The home page of a company displays the following form, where a user can specify interest in different products.

![Home Page Form Example](../images/script_guide_109.png)



The HTML code for the form is:

```html
<FORM action="http://www.ABCDEF.com/FormProcessor.exe" 
method="post">
<P>Your name: <INPUT type="text" name="yourname">
<SELECT name="interest">
     <OPTION selected>Modems</OPTION>
     <OPTION>CD-ROMs</OPTION>
   </SELECT>
   <INPUT type="submit" value="Send">
</FORM>
```

A script can download the form as follows:

```javascript
function InitAgenda() {
     wlGlobals.Url = "http://www.ABCDEF.com"
     wlGlobals.ParseForms = true
}
wlHttp.Get()
```

WebLOAD parses the HTML code and creates an elements collection containing the first two form elements (the text box and the drop-down list). WebLOAD does not include the third element (the Send button) in the collection because it does not have a name attribute.

This is a listing of the `elements` collection:

```xml
document.forms[0].elements[0].name = "yourname" 
document.forms[0].elements[0].type = "text" 
document.forms[0].elements[0].value = "" 
document.forms[0].elements[1].name = "interest" 
document.forms[0].elements[1].type = "SELECT" 
document.forms[0].elements[1].selectedindex = 0 
document.forms[0].elements[1].options[0].text = "Modems" 
document.forms[0].elements[1].options[0].value = "Modems" 
document.forms[0].elements[1].options[0].selected = true 
document.forms[0].elements[1].options[1].text = "CD-ROMs" 
document.forms[0].elements[1].options[1].value = "CD-ROMs" 
document.forms[0].elements[1].options[1].selected = false
```

The script can use the above data to post the form back to the server. The following code illustrates how the script might do this.

```javascript
MyArray = document.forms[0].elements i = 0
while (i < MyArray.length) { 
    switch MyArray[i].type { 
        case "text" :
         //Retrieve the default value of a text box 
         wlHttp.FormData[[MyArray[i].name] = MyArray[i].value] 
         break
         case "SELECT"
         //Retrieve the first option in a drop-down list
         wlHttp.FormData[MyArray[i].name]=MyArray[i].options[0].value         
         break
    }
i++
}
//Post the data to the form server
wlHttp.Post(document.forms[0].action)
```


## Managing Cookies through the wlCookie Object

### The wlCookie Object
The `wlCookie` object sets and deletes cookies. These activities may be required by an HTTP server.

> **Note:** You may use the methods of `wlCookie` to create as many cookies as needed. For example, each WebLOAD client running a script can set its own cookie identified by a unique name.

`wlCookie` is a local object. WebLOAD automatically creates an independent `wlCookie` object for each thread of a script. You cannot manually declare `wlCookie` objects yourself. See the *WebLOAD JavaScript Reference Guide* for a complete syntax specification for the `wlCookie` object and its methods.

### How WebLOAD Works with Cookies
WebLOAD always accepts cookies that are sent from a server. When WebLOAD connects to a server, it automatically submits any cookies in the server’s domain that it has stored. By default, WebLOAD clears the cookie cache after every round.

The `wlCookie` object lets you supplement or override this behavior in the following ways:

- A thread can create its own cookies.
- A thread can delete cookies that it created.

Except for the above, WebLOAD does not distinguish in any way between cookies that it receives from a server and those that you create yourself. For example, if a thread creates a cookie in a particular domain, it automatically submits the cookie when it connects to any server in the domain.



### wlCookie Methods
The `wlCookie` object works with the following methods:

- `ClearAll()`—Delete all cookies set by wlCookie in the current thread.
- `Delete()`—Delete the cookie identified by the method parameters. The cookie must have been previously created by `wlCookie`.
- `Get()`—Returns the cookie value. If there is more than one cookie with the same parameters it returns the first cookie.
- `Set()`—Creates a cookie. You can set an arbitrary number of cookies in any thread. If you set more than one cookie applying to a particular domain, WebLOAD submits them all when it connects to the domain.

> **Note:** Set cookies within the main script of the script. WebLOAD deletes all the cookies at the end of each round. If you wish to delete cookies in the middle of a round, use the `Delete()` or `ClearAll()` method.

### Example: using a cookie
Cookies are used by applications to store the application requests on the client side. This enables the client to perform a one-time application request and from then on the request information is retrieved from the client’s cookies.

```javascript
//Request information entered into the application 
wlHttp.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" 
wlHttp.FormData["username"] = "zadp10" 
wlHttp.FormData["password"] = "Start100" 
wlHttp.FormData["submit1"] = "Login"

//Setting the cookie
wlCookie.Set("UserID", "zapd10", "www.abcdef.net", "/", "Sun, 19- Jun-2011 17:29:00 GMT")

//WebLOAD submits the cookie 
wlHttp.Post("https://www.abcdef.net/default.aspx")

//Getting the cookie
CookieValue = wlCookie.Get("UserID")
//The value returned in CookieValue is "zapd10"
```

In some cases it is also necessary to delete the cookie settings. You can do this by entering:
```
    //Delete the cookie 
    wlCookie.ClearAll()

```

## Handling Binary Data

WebLOAD supports the simulation of binary data sent from the browser to the server. Binary data is handled specially, since it cannot be displayed as JavaScript literals in the script, unlike other types of data that can be displayed, such as numbers or text.

### Recording Binary Data
WebLOAD supports recording binary data in a script in one of the following ways:

- Recording binary data as a data file, which is external to the script.
- Encoding binary data in the script, so that you can view and edit the data.

#### Recording Binary Data as a Data File

Modifying the script Options settings in the WebLOAD Recorder enables writing binary data into a data file, which is stored locally. When working with data files, only the name of the file is stored in the script itself.

Recording binary data as a data file, enables WebLOAD to simulate sending binary data to the application, although the data itself cannot be edited in the script.

**To record binary data as a data file:**

1. In WebLOAD Recorder, select **Tools Recording and Script Generation Options**. The Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box appears.

1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box select the **Post Data**tab. 

    The Post Data tab appears. 

    ![Recording and Script Generation Options – Post Data Tab](../images/script_guide_110.png)

   
1. In the Add New Type field, enter the binary content-type, such as application/x-amf, which is used for binary content generated by a Flash application.

1. Click **As DATAFILE**.

    The binary content-type is added to the DATAFILE block list.

1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, select the **Content Types** tab.

    The Content Types tab appears.

    ![Recording and Script Generation Options – Content Types Tab](../images/script_guide_111.png)


1. Ensure that the appropriate binary content-type appears in the Recorded Types area. If the content does not appear, add the binary content type in the Add new content type field and click **Add**.

    After setting the Record Option settings, binary data is stored in a local data file and the name of the file appears in the script.

The following sample script demonstrates how WebLOAD records binary data as a data file:

```javascript
function InitAgenda()
{
CopyFile("wl2288601006.dat","wl2288601006.dat")
}
wlGlobals.GetFrames = false 
wlHttp.Get("http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html")

Sleep(9056)
wlHttp.Header["Referer"] = 
"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf"
wlHttp.Header["Content-type"] = "application/x-amf" 
wlHttp.Header["Content-length"] = "58" 
wlHttp.DataFile["Type"] = "application/x-amf" 
wlHttp.DataFile["Filename"] = "wl2288601006.dat"
wlHttp.Post("http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway.php")
```


#### Encoding Binary Data in the script

Modifying the script Options settings in the WebLOAD Recorder enables the encoding of binary data in the script during the recording. Once recorded, the script can be edited, parameterized, and load tested as a regular script.

**To enable encoding binary data in the script:**

1. In WebLOAD Recorder, select the **Tools**  **Recording and Script Generation Options** dialog box.

    The Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box appears.

1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box select the **Script Generation** tab.

    The Script Generation tab appears.

    ![Recording and Script Generation Options - Script Generation Tab](../images/script_guide_112.png)

1. Select the **Encode binary data** checkbox.

    This enables the user to view and parameterize the binary content.

1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, select the **Post Data** tab.

    The Post Data tab appears.

    <a name = "recording_and_script_generation_options"></a>
    ![Recording and Script Generation Options – Post Data Tab](../images/script_guide_113.png)

1. In the Add New Type field, enter the binary content-type, such as `application/x-amf`, which is used for binary text generated by a Flash application.

1. Click **As DATA**. 
     The binary content-type is added to the DATA block list.

1. In the Recording and Script Generation Options dialog box, select the **Content Types** tab.

    The Content Types tab appears (see the [Figure](#recording_and_script_generation_options)).

1. Ensure that the appropriate binary content-type appears in the Recorded Types area. If the content does not appear, add the binary content type in the Add new content type field and click **Add**.

 After setting the Record Option settings, when binary data is recorded and encoded in a script, `wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true` is automatically added to the script. This encodes the binary data into the following usable format:



`wlHttp.Data["Value"] = "%00%00%00%00%00%01%00/com.oreilly.frdg.SearchProducts.getSearch Result%00%02/1%00%00%00%18%0a%00%00%00%01%03%00%06search%02%00%0 4wood%00%00%09"`

The following sample script demonstrates how WebLOAD handles binary data encoded in the script:

```javascript
function InitAgenda()
{
IncludeFile("wlamf.js",WLExecuteScript);
}

wlGlobals.GetFrames = false 
wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true

wlGlobals.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)"
wlHttp.Get("http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html")

wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true
wlHttp.Header["Referer"] = 
"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html"
wlHttp.Get("http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.htm")

wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true
wlHttp.Header["Referer"] = 
"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.htm"
wlHttp.Get("http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/history.swf")

wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true
wlHttp.Header["Referer"] = 
"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html)[ttp://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Sample.html"
wlHttp.Get("http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf")

wlHttp.EncodeRequestBinaryData = true
wlHttp.Header["Referer"] = 
"http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flex/bin/Shop.swf"
wlHttp.Data["Type"] = "application/x-amf" 
wlHttp.Data["Value"] =
"%00%03%00%00%00%01%00%15talkback.returnString%00%02/1%00%00%00% 15%0a%00%00%00%02%02%00%06George%02%00%04Bush"
wlHttp.Post("http://www.webloadmpstore.com/flashservices/gateway.php")
```

## Handling Authentication in the Script

WebLOAD supports working with scripts containing Basic, NTLM, and Kerberos user authentication methods.

WebLOAD handles authentication in playback in the following way:

1. WebLOAD sends a regular request with no request for authentication, to which the server responds with an "unauthorized" error (401), and a prompt to enter a username and password.
1. If WebLOAD is using:
     - **Basic authentication**, WebLOAD encrypts the username and password in `wlHttp.Username` and `wlHttp.Password`, and makes a request.
    - **NTLM authentication**, WebLOAD sets the following:
       `wlGlobals.AuthType = "NTLM"`, where `NTLM` is the default value if no authentication type is specified.
    - **Kerberos authentication**, WebLOAD sets the following:
        `wlGlobals.AuthType = "Kerberos"`.

       `wlGlobals.KDCServer = <server name>`. If no value is specified for KDCServer, the authentication type is automatically assumed to be `NTLM`, even if the `AuthType` is `Kerberos`.

The following examples demonstrate the authentication processes in WebLOAD.

**Kerberos authentication:**

`wlGlobals.AuthType = "Kerberos"` 

`wlGlobals.KDCServer = "mulier.qalab.internal"` 

`wlHttp.NTPassWord = "Buga859"` 

`wlHttp.NTUserName = "qalab.internal\\test"` 

`wlHttp.Get("<http://mulier.qalab.internal/>")`



 **NTLM authentication:**

`wlGlobals.AuthType = "NTLM"` 

`wlHttp.NTPassWord = "Buga859"` 

`wlHttp.NTUserName = "qalab.internal\\test"` 

`wlHttp.Get("<http://mulier.qalab.internal/>")`

OR

`wlHttp.NTPassWord = "Buga859"` 

`wlHttp.NTUserName = "qalab.internal\\test"` 

`wlHttp.Get("<http://mulier.qalab.internal/>")`



**Basic authentication:**

`wlHttp.PassWord = "Buga859"` 

`wlHttp.UserName = "test"`

`wlHttp.Get("<http://mulier.qalab.internal/>")`
